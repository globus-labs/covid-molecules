Abstract  Clinical characteristics of novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) have been described in numerous studies but yielded varying results. We aimed to conduct a systematic review on scientific literatures and to synthesize critical data on clinical traits of COVID-19 from its initial outbreak to pandemic.Systematic searches were conducted to identify retrospective observational study that contained clinical characteristics on COVID-19 through multiple databases. Two reviewers independently evaluated eligible publications. Data on clinical characteristics of COVID-19 were extracted and analyzed.RESULTS-two retrospective studies demonstrating the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 were included. The most common symptom was fever (2878 [83.0%]), and 63.4% of the patients presented fever as onset symptom. There were 2528 [88.2%] of 2866 cases had abnormal lung findings on chest CT scan. Laboratory findings showed that 1498 [62.8%] of 2387 cases had lymphopenia, and 1354 [64.8%] of 2091 cases had an increased level of C-reactive protein (CRP). A total of 185 [11.5%] patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) while the overall case fatality rate (CFR) was 3.7%. Compared to patients admitted outside of Hubei, China, those from Hubei had a significant higher ICU admission rate (21.9% vs. 2.5%, p<0.001). Also, CFR attributed to COVID-19 was significantly higher in Hubei than that of non-Hubei admissions (10.4% vs. 0.6%, p<0.001).This large patient-based systematic review presents a more precise profiling of the COVID-19 from its outbreak to current pandemic. Dynamic evolvements of COVID-19 are needed to be characterized in future studies.  
Abstract  The advent of the genomic era has made elucidating gene function at large scale a pressing challenge. ORFeome collections, whereby almost all ORFs of a given species are cloned and can be subsequently leveraged in multiple functional genomic approaches, represent valuable resources towards this endeavor. Here we provide novel, genome-scale tools for the study of Candida albicans, a commensal yeast that is also responsible for frequent superficial and disseminated infections in humans. We have generated an ORFeome collection composed of 5,102 ORFs cloned in a Gateway™ donor vector, representing 83% of the currently annotated coding sequences of C. albicans. Sequencing data of the cloned ORFs are available in the CandidaOrfDB database at http://candidaorfeome.eu. We also engineered 49 expression vectors with a choice of promoters, tags, and selection markers and demonstrated their applicability to the study of target ORFs transferred from the C. albicans ORFeome. In addition, the use of the ORFeome in the detection of protein-protein interaction was demonstrated. Mating-compatible strains as well as Gateway™-compatible two-hybrid vectors were engineered, validated and used in a proof of concept experiment. These unique and valuable resources should greatly facilitate future functional studies in C. albicans and the elucidation of mechanisms that underlie its pathogenicity. author/funder.

Most ORFeome libraries are created using the highly versatile Gateway™ cloning approach (30).The Gateway™ technology employs the recombination system of bacteriophage lambda with two sets of reactions: the BP reaction, catalysed by Gateway™ BP Clonase™, facilitates recombination between attB and attP sequences, and the LR reaction, catalysed by Gateway™ LR Clonase™, promotes recombination between attL and attR sequences (30).Previously, we have reported the development of a first generation C. albicans ORFeome, in which 644 full-length ORFs, encoding signaling proteins (transcription factors and kinases), as well as cell wall proteins and proteins involved in DNA processes (repair, replication and recombination), were cloned in the Gateway™ vector pDONR207 (31). Here we describe the generation and validation of the latest Candida albicans ORFeome collection, which consists of 5,102 ORFs in pDONR207, allowing the transfer of the cloned genes into a variety of C.albicans Gateway™-compatible expression vectors. To this end, we also provide a panel of 15 expression vectors that differ in the combination of promoter/selection marker they are carrying, and give different options regarding the tagging of the cloned gene product. These 15 expression vectors have been validated using the filament-specific transcription factor UME6. In addition, we also provide a secondary collection of 34 expression vectors with additional options regarding the choice of the promoter and the tagging of the cloned gene product.

Abstract  The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 has spread rapidly and sparked global concern. While the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through human respiratory droplets and contact with infected persons is clear, the aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been little studied.Methods: Thirty-five aerosol samples of three different types (total suspended particle, size segregated and deposition aerosol) were collected in Patient Areas (PAA) and Medical Staff Areas (MSA) of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Renmin) and Wuchang Fangcang Field Hospital (Fangcang), and Public Areas (PUA) in Wuhan, China during COVID-19 outbreak. A robust droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) method was employed to quantitate the viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome and determine aerosol RNA concentration.The ICU, CCU and general patient rooms inside Renmin, patient hall inside Fangcang had undetectable or low airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration but deposition samples inside ICU and air sample in Fangcang patient toilet tested positive. The airborne SARS-CoV-2 in Fangcang MSA had bimodal distribution with higher concentration than those in Renmin during the outbreak but turned negative after patients number reduced and rigorous sanitization implemented. PUA had undetectable airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration but obviously increased with accumulating crowd flow.Room ventilation, open space, proper use and disinfection of toilet can effectively limit aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Gathering of crowds with asymptomatic carriers is a potential source of airborne SARS-CoV-2. The virus aerosol deposition on protective apparel or floor surface and their subsequent resuspension is a potential transmission pathway and effective sanitization is critical in minimizing aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2.  
Abstract  The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak on the Diamond Princess ship has caused over 634 cases as of February 20, 2020. We model the transmission process on the ship with a stochastic model and estimate the basic reproduction number at 2.2 (95%CI: 2.1−2.4). We estimate a large dispersion parameter than other coronaviruses, which implies that the virus is difficult to go extinction. The epidemic doubling time is at 4.6 days (95%CI: 3.0−9.3), and thus timely actions were crucial. The lesson learnt on the ship is generally applicable in other settings.  
Abstract  The recent outbreak of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan, China, underscores the need for understanding the evolutionary processes that drive the emergence and adaptation of zoonotic viruses in humans. Here, we show that recombination in betacoronaviruses, including human-infecting viruses like SARS and MERS, frequently encompasses the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) in the Spike gene.We find that this common process likely led to a recombination event at least 11 years ago in an ancestor of the 2019-nCoV involving the RBD. Compared with bat isolates, the recent ancestors of 2019-nCoV accumulated a high number of amino acid substitutions in the RBD and likewise in a region of polyprotein Orf1a that is critical for viral replication and transcription. Among these recent mutations, we identify amino acid substitutions common to the SARS 2003 outbreak isolates in positions 427N and 436Y, indicating potential adaptive convergent evolution. Both 427N and 436Y belong to a helix that appears to interact with the human ACE2 receptor. In sum, we propose a two-hit scenario in the emergence of the 2019-nCoV virus whereby the 2019-nCoV ancestors in bats first acquired genetic characteristics of SARS by incorporation of a SARS-like RBD through recombination before 2009, and subsequently, those recombinants underwent convergent evolution.  
Abstract  The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2) has spread more rapidly than any other betacoronavirus including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.However, the mechanisms responsible for infection and molecular evolution of this virus remained unclear. 5 Methods: We collected and analyzed 120 genomic sequences of 2019-nCoV including 11 novel genomes from patients in China. Through comprehensive analysis of the available genome sequences of 2019-nCoV strains, we have tracked multiple inheritable SNPs and determined the evolution of 2019-nCoV relative to other coronaviruses. 10 Results: Systematic analysis of 120 genomic sequences of 2019-nCoV revealed cocirculation of two genetic subgroups with distinct SNPs markers, which can be used to trace the 2019-nCoV spreading pathways to different regions and countries. Although 2019-nCoV, human and bat SARS-CoV share high homologous in overall genome structures, they evolved into two distinct groups with different receptor entry specificities 15through potential recombination in the receptor binding regions. In addition, 2019-nCoV has a unique four amino acid insertion between S1 and S2 domains of the spike protein, which created a potential furin or TMPRSS2 cleavage site.Our studies provided comprehensive insights into the evolution and spread of the 2019-nCoV. Our results provided evidence suggesting that 2019-nCoV 20 may increase its infectivity through the receptor binding domain recombination and a cleavage site insertion. author/funder.

Abstract  Human Coronaviruses (HCoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), lead global epidemics with high morbidity and mortality. However, there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-nCoV. Drug repurposing, represented as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay between the HCoV-host interactome and drug targets in the human protein-protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV whole genomes reveal that 2019-nCoV has the highest nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%) among the six other known pathogenic HCoVs. Specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV are two evolutionarily conserved regions, having the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to SARS-CoV.Using network proximity analyses of drug targets and known HCoV-host interactions in the human protein-protein interactome, we computationally identified 135 putative repurposable drugs for the potential prevention and treatment of HCoVs. In addition, we prioritized 16 potential anti-HCoV repurposable drugs (including melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that were further validated by enrichment analyses of drug-gene signatures and HCoV-induced transcriptomics data in human cell lines.Finally, we showcased three potential drug combinations (including sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured by .

Abstract  In the analysis of genomic sequence data, so-called "alignment free" approaches are often 12 selected for their relative speed compared to alignment-based approaches, especially in the 13 application of distance comparisons and taxonomic classification 1,2,3,4 . These methods are 14 typically reliant on excising K-length substrings of the input sequence, called K-mers 5 . In 15 the context of machine learning, K-mer based feature vectors have been used in 16 applications ranging from amplicon sequencing classification to predictive modeling for 17 antimicrobial resistance genes 6,7,8 . This can be seen as an analogy of the "bag-of-words" 18 model successfully employed in natural language processing and computer vision for 19 document and image classification 9,10 . Feature extraction techniques from natural language 20 processing have previously been analogized to genomics data 11 ; however, the "bag-of-21words" approach is brittle in the RNA virus space due to the high intersequence variance 22 and the exact matching requirement of K-mers. To reconcile the simplicity of "bag-of-23words" methods with the complications presented by the intrinsic variance of RNA virus 24 space, a method to resolve the fragility of extracted K-mers in a way that faithfully reflects 25 an underlying biological phenomenon was devised. Our algorithm, Vorpal, allows the 26 construction of interpretable linear models with clustered, representative 'degenerate' K-27 mers as the input vector and, through regularization, sparse predictors of binary 28 phenotypes as the output. Here, we demonstrate the utility of Vorpal by identifying 29 nucleotide-level genomic motif predictors for binary phenotypes in three separate RNA 30 virus clades; human pathogen vs. non-human pathogen in Orthocoronavirinae, 31 hemorrhagic fever causing vs. non-hemorrhagic fever causing in Ebolavirus, and human-32 host vs. non-human host in Influenza A. The capacity of this approach for in silico 33 identification of hypotheses which can be validated by direct experimentation, as well as 34 identification of genomic targets for preemptive biosurveillance of emerging viruses, is 35 discussed. The code is available for download at https://github.com/mriglobal/vorpal. 36 37 Feature Extraction Algorithm Overview 38In the quasispecies model, the virus organism is represented by the "cloud" of genotypes that can 39 be maintained by the virus within the allowable fitness parameters 12 .

Abstract  Classifying the mechanisms of antibiotic failure has led to the development of new treatment strategies for killing bacteria. Among the currently described mechanismswhich include resistance, persistence and tolerancewe propose defiance as a subclass of antibiotic failure specific to prodrugs. Using locked antimicrobial peptides (AMP) that are activated by bacterial 5 proteases as a prototypic prodrug, we observe that although treatment eliminates bacteria across the vast majority of environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, concentration of growth nutrients), bacteria spontaneously switch from susceptibility to defiance under conditions that alter the competing rates between bacterial proliferation and prodrug activation. To identify the determinants of this switch-like behavior, we model bacteria-prodrug dynamics as a multi-rate 10 feedback system and identify a dimensionless quantity we call the Bacterial Advantage Heuristic (BAH) that perfectly classifies bacteria as either defiant or susceptible across a broad range of treatment conditions. By recognizing that the bacterial switch from susceptibility to defiance behaves analogously to electronic transistors, we construct prodrug logic gates (e.g., AND, OR, NOT, etc.) to allow assembly of an integrated 3-bit multi-prodrug circuit that kills defiant bacteria 15 under all possible combinations of BAH values (i.e., 000, 001, …, 111) that represent a broad range of possible treatment conditions. Our study identifies a form of bacterial resistance specific to prodrugs that is described by a predictive dimensionless constant to reveal logic-based treatment strategies using multi-prodrug biological circuits.  
Abstract  The effective reproduction number, Rt, is an important prognostic for 2 infectious disease epidemics. Significant changes in Rt can forewarn about 3 new transmissions or predict the efficacy of interventions. The renewal 4 model infers Rt from incidence data and has been applied to Ebola virus 5 disease and pandemic influenza outbreaks, among others. This model 6 estimates Rt using a sliding window of length k. While this facilitates 7 real-time detection of statistically significant Rt fluctuations, inference is 8 highly k -sensitive. Models with too large or small k might ignore meaning-9 ful changes or over-interpret noise-induced ones. No principled k -selection 10 scheme exists. We develop a practical yet rigorous scheme using the ac-11 cumulated prediction error (APE) metric from information theory. We 12 derive exact incidence prediction distributions and integrate these within 13 an APE framework to identify the k best supported by available data. We 14 find that this k optimises short-term prediction accuracy and expose how 15 common, heuristic k -choices, which seem sensible, could be misleading. 16 18 fectious disease epidemic is known as an incidence curve or epi-curve [1]. At 19 the population level, these curves offer prospective insight into the spread of a 20 disease by informing on the effective reproduction number, which defines the 21 average number of secondary infections induced by a primary one [2]. This 22reproduction number, denoted R t at time t, is an important prognostic of the 23 behaviour of an epidemic. If R t > 1, for example, we can expect and hence 24 prepare for an exponentially increasing incidence, whereas if R t < 1, we can be 25 1 .

Reliably estimat-26 ing meaningful changes in R t is an important problem in epidemiology, since 27 it can forewarn about the growth rate of an outbreak and signify the level of 28 control effort that must be initiated or sustained [3] [4]. 29 The renewal model [5] is a popular approach for inferring salient fluctuations 30 in R t and has been used to predict Ebola virus disease case counts and assess the 31 transmission potential of pandemic influenza and Zika virus, among others [6] [7] 32 [3]. The renewal model may be applied retrospectively to understand the past 33 behaviour of an epidemic or prospectively to gain real-time insight into ongoing 34 outbreak dynamics [8] [5]. We only consider the latter here. Model selection 35 metrics for the former application were investigated in [9]. The prospective ap-36 proach approximates R t with a piecewise-constant function i.e. R t is considered 37 constant or stable over some sliding window of k time units (e.g. days or weeks) 38 into the past, beyond which a discontinuous change is assumed [8].39 This formulation models the non-stationary nature of epidemics, capturing 40 the idea that different dynamics are expected during distinct phases (e.g. onset, 41 growth, control) of the epidemic lifetime. The window length, k, is effectively a 42 hypothesis about the stability of R t underpinning the observed epi-curve and is 43 critical to reliably characterising the epidemic because it controls the time-scale 44 over which R t fluctuations are deemed significant. Too large or small a k-value 45 can respectively lead to over-smoothing (which ignores important changes) or 46 to random noise being misinterpreted as meaningful. Inferring under the wrong 47 k can appreciably affect our understanding of an epidemic, as observed in [5], 48 where case reproduction numbers (a common k-grouping of R t ) were found to 49 over-smooth significant changes in HIV transmission, for example.50 Surprisingly, no principled method for optimally selecting k exists. Current 51 best practice either relies on heuristic choices (including visual trial and error) [6] 52 or provides implicit, minimum thresholds for k [8]. Here we adapt metrics from 53 information theory to develop a simple yet rigorous framework for optimising k.54Specifically, we analytically derive the posterior predictive incidence distribution 55 of the renewal model and then minimise its accumulated prediction error (APE) 56 [10] over the space of possible k, to obtain k * . The APE is a formal, data-57 driven, model selection strategy that identifies the k * most justified by the 58 available incidence data by optimising for short-term predictive accuracy [11] .The renewal model with this k * best explains the observed epi-curve.The APE metric is valid for all sample sizes, is easily computed for models of 61 arbitrary dimension and is strongly linked to Bayesian model selection (BMS), 62 cross validation and minimum description length (MDL) [12] [13]. Unlike many 63 standard model selection approaches, the APE accounts for parametric com-64 plexity, which describes how functional dependencies among parameters matter 65 [14]. Ignoring parametric complexity is known to promote suboptimal renewal 66 model selection performance [9]. The APE metric deems the model that best 67predicts unseen data from the same underlying process, and not the one that 68 best fits existing data, as optimal and of justified complexity [15].Our APE-based approach should therefore pinpoint and characterise only 70 those reproduction number fluctuations that are key to achieving reliable short-The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

The performance, speed and computational ease of 72 our approach makes it suitable for real-time forecasting and model selection.It could serve as a stand-alone computational tool or be integrated within ex-74 isting real-time frameworks, such as in [4], to provide emerging insights into 75 infectious transmission dynamics, or to assess the prospective efficacy of im-76 plemented interventions (e.g. vaccination or quarantine). Public health policy 77 decisions or preparedness plans based on improperly specified k-windows could 78 be misinformed or overconfident. Our approach will hopefully limit these risks. 79 Results 80 Problem Definition 81 Let the incidence or number of infected cases in an epidemic at present time t, 82 be I t . The incidence curve is a historical record of these case counts from the 83 start of the outbreak [1], and is summarised as I t 1 = {I s : 1 ≤ s ≤ t}, with s as a 84 time-indexing variable. For convenience, we assume that incidence is available 85 on a daily scale so that I t 1 is a vector of t daily counts (though in general weeks 86 or months could be used instead). The associated effective reproduction number 87 and total infectiousness of the epidemic are denoted R t and Λ t , respectively. 88 Here R t is the number of secondary cases that are induced, on average, by 89 a single primary case at t [2], while Λ t measures the cumulative impact of past 90 cases, from the epidemic origin at s = 1, on the present. The generation time 91 distribution of the epidemic, which describes the elapsed time between a primary 92 and secondary case, controls Λ t (see Methods). In the problems we consider, I t 1 93 and Λ t 1 form our data, the generation time distribution is assumed known, and 94 R t 1 or some grouping of this vector are the parameters to be inferred. 95 The renewal model [5] [6] derives from the classic renewal epidemic trans-96 mission equation [26], and defines the Poisson distributed (Poiss) relationship 97 I t ∼ Poiss (R t Λ t ). This means that P(x) = 1 /x! e −RtΛt (R t Λ t ) x , with x in-98 dexing possible I t values. This formulation assumes maximum epidemic non-99 stationarity (i.e. that transmission statistics change every time unit) and hence 100 only uses the most recent data (I t , Λ t ) to infer the current R t . While this max-101 imises the fitting flexibility of the renewal model, it often results in noisy and 102 unreliable estimates that possess many spurious reproduction number changes 103 [6]. Consequently, grouping is employed. This hypothesises that the repro-104 duction number is constant over a k-day window into the past and leads to a 105 piecewise-constant function that separates salient fluctuations (change-points) 106 from negligible ones (the constant segments) [8] [9]. 107 We use R τ (t) to indicate that the present reproduction number to be inferred 108 is stationary (constant) over the last k points of the incidence curve i.e. the time 109 window τ (t) := {t, t − 1, . . . , t − k + 1}. The data used to estimate R τ (t) is 110 then (I t t−k+1 , Λ t t−k+1 ). This construction allows us to filter noise and increase 111 estimate reliability but elevates bias. In the Methods we show precisely how 112 grouping achieves this bias-variance trade-off. Choosing k therefore amounts to 113 3 .

Thus, it is necessary to find a principled method for balancing 116 k. Ultimately, we want to find a k, denoted k * , that (i) is best supported by 117 the epi-curve and (ii) maximises our confidence in making real-time, short-term 118 predictions that can inform prospective epidemic responses. 119 This is no trivial task as k * would be sensitive to both the specifically ob-120 served stochastic incidence of an epidemic and to how past infections propagate 121 forward in time. We solve (i)-(ii) by applying the accumulated prediction error 122 (APE) metric from information theory [10], which values models on their capac-123 ity to predict unseen data from the generating process instead of their ability to 124 fit existing data [11]. The properties and mathematical definition of the APE 125 355cept I s+1 are included [21]. Comparing this to Eq. (9) (see Methods) we see 356 that APE is a modified CV that is explicitly specialised for non-stationary, 357 accumulating time-series.(c) Lack of a 'true model'. It is highly unlikely that the underlying R t is truly 359 described by one of the piecewise-constant functions assumed within renewal 360 models. Unlike many model selection criteria, the APE does not require a true 361 model to exist within the set being evaluated [14]. It is only interested in finding 362 the model that best predicts the data and so emphasises accurate forecasting 363 and data-justified complexity. However, should a true model exist, the APE is 364 statistically consistent i.e. as data accumulate it will select the data-generating 365 model with probability 1 [14]. 366 We tested our metric on both simulated and empirical datasets. We started 367 by examining various distinct, time-varying reproduction number profiles in 368 Fig. 2 , for which no true model existed. By comparing the APE-optimised 369 k * against long and short window sizes, we found that not only does APE 370 meaningfully balance R t estimates to achieve good prediction capacity, but also 371 that getting k wrong could promote strikingly different conclusions from the 372 same dataset. This behaviour held consistent for outbreaks with both small 373 and large numbers of infecteds. 374 We then investigated several step-changing reproduction number examples 375 in Fig. 4 to better expose the underlying mechanics of our approach, and to 376 showcase its performance on epidemics with strong non-stationary transmission.These examples featured rapid changes, also known as events in information 378 theory, caused by effective and ineffective countermeasures [4]. In all cases, our 379 metric responded rapidly whilst maintaining reliable incidence predictions in 380 real-time. Such rapid, event-triggered responses (as in Fig. 5) are known to 381 be time-efficient [22]. A key objective of short-term forecasting is the speedy 382 diagnosis of intervention efficacy. Fig. 4 confirmed the practical value of our 383 method towards this objective. 384 While our metric is promising, we caution that much work remains to be 385 done. Standard Poisson renewal models, such as those we have considered here, 386 make several limiting assumptions including that (i) all cases are detected (i.e. 387 there is no significant sampling bias), (ii) the serial interval and generation time 388 distribution coincide and do not change over the epidemic lifetime and (iii) that 389 heterogeneities in transmission within the infected population have negligible 390 effect [8]. Our analysis of H1N1 influenza (1918) and SARS (2003) flagged 391 some of these concerns. Comparing the k * to previously recommended weekly 392 windows led to some interesting revelations.The APE approach selected a notably shorter window (k * = 2 days) for both 394 datasets. While this produced noisy R s estimates that seemed less reliable than 395 those obtained with weekly windows, the predicted incidence values were central 396 to understanding this discrepancy. The weekly windows were considerably worse 397 at forecasting the observed epi-curve, often systematically biased around the 398 peak of the epidemic and sometimes predicting multi-modal curves that were 399 not reflected by the existing data. From a model selection perspective, the 400 shorter windows are therefore justified. 401 However, the noisy R t estimates are still undesirable. Both datasets are 402 known to potentially contain super-spreading heterogeneities and other biases 403 that may lead to outliers [17] [8]. Moving-average filters were applied in [17] 404 15 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/835181 doi: bioRxiv preprint to remove these artefacts from the H1N1 data. We used the same technique 405 to regularise both datasets and then re-applied the APE. Results remained 406 consistent, providing evidence for the use of more flexible negative binomial 407 renewal models, which can better handle these biases. In an upcoming study 408 we will adapt the APE for these more general renewal methods. 409 Real-time, model-based epidemic forecasts are quickly becoming an inte-410 gral prognostic for resource allocation and strategic intervention planning [23]. 411 As global infectious disease threats elevate, model-supported predictions, which 412 can inform decision making, have become imperative. However, much is still un-413 known about the fundamentals of epidemic prediction and this uncertainty has 414 inspired some reluctance in public health applications [23]. As a result, recent 415 studies have called for careful evaluation of the predictive capacity of models, 416 and demonstrated the importance of having standard metrics to compare models 417 and qualify their uncertainties [24] [25]. 418 Here we have presented one such metric. Short-term forecasts aid immedi-419 ate decision making and are more actionable than long-term ones (reliability 420 decreases sharply with prediction horizon) [24] [23]. While we focussed on re-421 newal models, the general APE metric of Eq. (9) can select among diverse types 422 of models, facilitating comparative evaluation of their short-term predictive ca-423 pacity and reliability. Its direct use of posterior predictive distributions within 424 an honest, causal framework allows proper and problem-specific inclusion of 425 uncertainty [11]. Common metrics such as the mean absolute error lack this 426 adaptation [24]. Given its information-theoretic links and demonstrated perfor-427 mance we hope that our APE-based method can serve as a rigorous benchmark 428 [9] K. Parag and C.

Abstract  The current outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) by a novel 28 betacoronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-29 CoV-2) has aroused great public health concern. Coronavirus has a history of 30 causing epidemics in human and animals. In 2017 an outbreak in piglets by a 31 novel coronavirus was emerged designated as swine acute diarrhea 32 syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) which is originated from the same genus 33 of horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus) as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 34 (SARS-CoV) having a broad species tropism. In addition to human cells, it 35 can also infect cell lines from diverse species. Coronavirus host range is 36 determined by its spike glycoprotein (S). Given the importance of S protein in 37 viral entry to cells and host immune responses, here we report the cryo-EM 38 structure of the SADS-CoV S in the prefusion conformation at a resolution of 39 3.55 Å. Our study reveals that SADS-CoV S structure takes an intra-subunit 40 quaternary packing mode where the NTD and CTD from the same subunit 41 pack together by facing each other. The comparison of NTD and CTD with 42 that of the other four genera suggests the evolutionary process of the SADS-43 CoV S. Moreover, SADS-CoV S has several characteristic structural features, 44 such as more compact architecture of S trimer, and masking of epitopes by 45 glycan shielding, which may facilitate viral immune evasion. These data 46 provide new insights into the evolutionary relationships of SADS-CoV S and 47 would extend our understanding of structural and functional diversity, which 48 .  
Abstract  Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus is an alphacoronavirus responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in pigs. A key determinant of viral tropism and entry, the PEDV spike protein is a key target for the host antibody response and a good candidate for a protein-based vaccine immunogen. We used electron microscopy to evaluate the PEDV spike structure, as well as pig polyclonal antibody responses to viral infection. The structure of the PEDV spike reveals a configuration similar to that of HuCoV-NL63. Several PEDV protein-protein interfaces are mediated by non-protein components including a glycan at Asn264 and two bound palmitoleic acid molecules. The polyclonal antibody response to PEDV infection shows a dominance of epitopes in the S1 region. This structural and immune characterization provides new insights into coronavirus spike stability determinants and explores the immune landscape of viral spike proteins. : bioRxiv preprintBaculovirus expressed proteins were produced by infecting 1 L of Sf9 at 2´10 6 cells with 10 mL of second amplification baculovirus and incubating for four days.

Abstract  Members of the Nidovirales order have (+)RNA genomes amongst the largest in size in the RNA virus world. Expression of their genes is promoted through reading of genomic RNA and mRNA transcripts by the ribosome of the infected cell. The 5'-end of these RNAs is supposedly protected by an RNA-cap structure (m7GpppNm) whose most synthesis steps remain elusive. In Eukaryotes, the RNA-cap structure is methylated by RNA methyltransferases (MTases) at the RNA-cap N7-guanine position as well as the 2'-O methyl position of the first transcribed nucleotide. In Coronaviridae, two separate enzymes (nsp14 and nsp16) perform the N7-guanine and the 2'-OH methylation, respectively. One salient feature of the Nidovirales N7-guanine MTase nsp14 is that it is the only example of non-Rossman fold viral MTase known so far. Conversely, all other Nidovirales nsp16-like MTases have a canonical Rossman fold. Many Nidovirales members lack either any RNA MTase signature sequence (e.g., Arteriviridae), or lack a N7-guanine MTase signature sequence (e.g., Tobaniviridae, Euroniviridae, Roniviridae, Medioniviridae). Both nsp14-and nsp16-like enzyme genes are usually located in Orf1b encoding for the replication machinery. Here, we report the discovery of a putative Rossman fold RNA MTase in the Orf1a of ten Tobaniviridae members. Multiple sequence alignments and structural analyses identify this novel gene as a typical RNA-cap N7-guanine MTase with substrate specificity and active-site organization similar to the canonical eukaryotic RNA-cap N7-guanine MTase.author/funder.

The Coronaviridae family was further divided in two subfamilies, Coronavirinae and Torovirinae. The Torovirinae family contained two genus Torovirus and Bafinivirus, plus few unassigned species. Recently, the ICTV proposed a novel classification into the Nidovirales order, with the creation of nine families [1] . In this novel ICTV proposal, ratified on February 2019, Coronaviridae do not encompass both Coronavirinae and Toronavirinae subfamilies. Rather, the new suborder Tornidovirinae (including toroviruses and bafiniviruses) contains a novel family, Tobaniviridae, at the same level as the Coronaviridae, which is now within suborder Cornidovirineae. This new taxonomy is used here, as depicted in Fig. 1 .Nidovirales have attracted much attention in the past decades for being causative agents of serious diseases in humans and animals. In humans, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses (CoVs) have been associated with high fatality/case ratios of ∼10% and ∼35 %, respectively (reviewed in [2]). In animals, pathogens of significant economical and societal impact include Equine Arteritis virus (EAV, Alphaarterivirus equid) and Porcine Reproductive Respiratory Syndrome virus (PRSSV 1-2, Betaarterivirus suid 1-2).Two salient features of these viruses are, amongst others, their complex and still obscure replication/transcription mechanism as well as their broad genome-size range. Genomes of Arteriviridae (12.7 -15.7 kb in length), Mesoniviridae (∼20 kb), Medioniviridae (20.2 -25 kb), Euroniviridae (∼24.5 kb), Roniviridae (∼26 kb) Tobaniviridae and Coronaviridae (∼27-32 kb), Abyssoviridae (35.9 kb), and Mononiviridae (41.1 kb) members, share a similar genomic organisation generating viral mRNAs from a fixed genomic location, the 'nest', which has inspired the family name (Nido : latin for 'nest') [3, 4] . Nidovirales genomic and mRNAs are presumably capped, although direct demonstration of the presence of an RNA cap structure is still missing for many of these Nidovirales members.In Eukaryotes, the RNA cap structure is thought to be synthesized post-transcriptionally [5] .Most of (+)RNA viruses supposedly follow a conventional RNA capping pathway [6] in which nascent viral 5'-triphosphate genomic (or mRNAs) is thought to be processed through three enzymatic reactions to yield an RNA cap whose structure is indistinguishable from that of cellular mRNAs. The capping pathway implies that the 5'-triphosphate RNA is hydrolyzed into 5'-diphosphate by an RNA triphosphatase, a GMP residue (the « cap », coming from GTP) is next covalently transferred to the 5'-diphosphate RNA in the 5' to 5' orientation by a guanlylyltransferase (GTase), releasing inorganic pyrophosphate. Both the cap and the first transcribed nucleotide are then methylated at the N7-guanine (mGpppN-RNA, so-called Cap0 structure) and the 2'-oxygen position (mGpppNm-RNA, Cap1 structure) by one or two RNA methyltransferases (MTases), respectively. The MTase uses S-Adenosyl-Methionine (SAM) as the methyl donor and releases S-Adenosyl-homocysteine (SAH).There is no high-resolution structural analysis available of Nidovirales RNA caps. The evidence for their presence comes from immunological detection in Torovirus genomic and mRNAs [7] , and co-migration analysis in low-resolution chromatographic techniques for MHV [8] and Simian Hemorragic fever virus [9] . In other instances, Nidovirales cap structures supposedly conform to the canonical eukaryotic RNA capping pathway because enzymes usually deemed necessary to perform RNA capping are present in cognate genomes (reviewed in [6]). Bioinformatic analyses have been used to detect signature-sequences typically associated with RNA capping/modifying enzymes i.e guanlylyltransferase (GTase), polymerase, helicase, nuclease, and methyltransferase (MTase). These signature-sequences have served in many instances to isolate corresponding enzymes endowed with the predicted activity. In Nidovirales, this approach has been pioneered for Coronavirus enzymes, yet author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.  
Abstract  Corona virus disease 2019 has rapidly become the most severe public health issue all over the world. Despite respiratory symptoms, hepatic injury has also been observed in clinical settings. This study aimed to investigate the risk factors involved with hepatic injury in the patients with COVID-19.Methods: A total of 85 hospitalized patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in Beijing You'an Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. According to liver function, they were divided into ALT normal group (n=52) and ALT elevation group (n=33).Clinical features and laboratory data were compared between the two groups. The independent risk factors for liver injury were analyzed.Results: There were 33 patients with hepatic injury in our study, accounting for 38.8%(33/85). The patients in ALT elevation group were older than those in ALT normal group. The levels of lactic acid, CRP, myoglobin, and neutrophils were significantly higher in ALT elevation group. The lymphocytes and albumin were significantly lower in ALT elevation group. The proportion of severe and critical patients in ALT elevation group was significantly higher. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed CRP ≥ 20 mg/L and lymphocyte count< 1.1×10^9/L were independently related to hepatic injury.Lymphopenia and CRP may serve as the risk factors related to hepatic injury in patients with COVID-19, which might be related to inflammatory cytokine storm in liver injury. Early detection and timely treatment of hepatic injury in patients with COVID-19 are necessary.  
Abstract  Social mixing patterns are crucial in driving transmission of infectious diseases and informing public health interventions to contain their spread. Age-specific social mixing is often inferred from surveys of self-recorded contacts which by design often have a very limited number of participants. In addition, such surveys are rare, so public health interventions are often evaluated by considering only one such study. Here we report detailed population contact patterns for  
Abstract  Background With the spread of COVID-19 from Wuhan, Hubei Province to other areas of the country, medical staff in Fever Clinics faced the challenge of identifying suspected cases among febrile patients with acute respiratory infections. We aimed to describe the prevalence and clinical features of COVID-19 as compared to pneumonias of other etiologies in a Fever Clinic in Beijing.  
Abstract  One of the key characteristics of the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases is the generation time which refers to the time interval between the infection of a secondary case and the infection of its infector. The generation time distribution together with the reproduction number determines the rate at which an infection spreads in a population. When defining the generation time distribution at a calendar time t two definitions are plausible according whether we regard t as the infection time of the infector or the infection time of the infectee. The resulting measurements are respectively called forward generation time and backward generation time. It has been observed that the mean forward generation time contracts around the peak of an epidemic. This contraction effect has previously been attributed to either competition among potential infectors or depletion of susceptibles in the population. The first explanation requires many infectives for contraction to occur whereas the latter explanation suggests that contraction occurs even when there are few infectives. With a simulation study we show that both competition and depletion cause the mean forward generation time to contract. Our results also reveal that the distribution of the infectious period and the reproduction number have a strong effect on the size and timing of the contraction, as well as on the mean value of the generation time in both forward and backward scheme. These observations relate to the 'serial interval', the time interval between symptom 26 onset of a secondary case and symptom onset of its infector [10]. Many authors have 27 used the serial interval as a synonym for the generation time. However, unlike the 28 generation time, the serial interval can have a negative duration when the clinical 29 March 5, 2019 2/23 .

Abstract  A newly identified coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, has been posing significant threats to public health since December 2019. ACE2, the host cell receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS), has recently been demonstrated in mediating 2019-nCoV infection. Interestingly, besides the respiratory system, substantial proportion of SARS and 2019-nCoV patients showed signs of various degrees of liver damage, the mechanism and implication of which have not yet been determined. Here, we performed an unbiased evaluation of cell type specific expression of ACE2 in healthy liver tissues using single cell RNA-seq data of two independent cohorts, and identified specific expression in cholangiocytes. The results indicated that virus might directly bind to ACE2 positive cholangiocytes but not necessarily hepatocytes. This finding suggested the liver abnormalities of SARS and 2019-nCoV patients may not be due to hepatocyte damage, but cholangiocyte dysfunction and other causes such as drug induced and systemic inflammatory response induced liver injury. Our findings indicate that special care of liver dysfunction should be installed in treating 2019-nCoV patients during the hospitalization and shortly after cure. : bioRxiv preprint rise of liver enzymes, implying liver function damage in patients infected with MERS-CoV [9].An very recent epidemiologic study revealed that 43 out of 99 initial patients infected with 2019-nCoV had various degrees of liver function abnormality, with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) above the normal range, and more important, one  
Abstract  Background: An outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has led to 46,997 confirmed cases as of 13 th February 2020. Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas.We combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of novel coronavirus disease in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January and February 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas.We estimated that the median daily reproduction number, R t , declined from 2.35 (95% CI: 1.15-4.77) one week before travel restrictions were introduced on 23 rd January to 1.05 (95% CI: 0.413-2.39) one week after. Based on our estimates of R t ,we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential as Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population.  
Abstract  Background: As the COVID-19 epidemic is spreading, incoming data allows us to quantify values of key variables that determine the transmission and the effort required to control the epidemic. We determine the incubation period and serial interval distribution for transmission clusters in Singapore and in Tianjin. We infer the basic reproduction number and identify the extent of pre-symptomatic transmission.Methods: We collected outbreak information from Singapore and Tianjin, China, reported from Jan.19-Feb.26 and Jan.21-Feb.27, respectively. We estimated incubation periods and serial intervals in both populations.Results: The mean incubation period was 7.1 (6.13, 8.25) days for Singapore and 9 (7.92, 10.2) days for Tianjin. Both datasets had shorter incubation periods for earlier-occurring cases. The mean serial interval was 4.56 (2.69, 6.42) days for Singapore and 4.22 (3.43, 5.01) for Tianjin. We inferred that early in the outbreaks, infection was transmitted on average 2.55 and 2.89 days before symptom onset (Singapore, Tianjin). The estimated basic reproduction number for Singapore was 1.97 (1.45, 2.48) secondary cases per infective; for Tianjin it was 1.87 (1.65, 2.09) secondary cases per infective.Conclusions: Estimated serial intervals are shorter than incubation periods in both Singapore and Tianjin, suggesting that pre-symptomatic transmission is occurring. Shorter serial intervals lead to lower estimates of R0, which suggest that half of all secondary infections should be prevented to control spread.  
Abstract  All viruses balance interactions between cellular machinery co-opted to support replication and host factors deployed to halt the infection. We used gene correlation analysis to perform an unbiased screen for host factors involved in influenza A virus (FLUAV) infection. Our screen identified the cellular factor epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 8 (EPS8) as the highest confidence pro-viral candidate. Knockout and overexpression of EPS8 confirmed its importance in enhancing FLUAV infection and titers. Loss of EPS8 did not affect virion attachment, uptake, or fusion. Rather, our data show that EPS8 specifically functions during virion uncoating. EPS8 physically associated with incoming virion components, and subsequent nuclear import of released ribonucleoprotein complexes was significantly delayed in the absence of EPS8. Our study identified EPS8 as a host factor important for uncoating, a crucial step of FLUAV infection during which the interface between the virus and host is still being discovered.  
Abstract  The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is currently causing a widespread outbreak centered on Hubei province, China and is a major public health concern. Taxonomically 2019-nCoV is closely related to SARS-CoV and SARS-related bat coronaviruses, and it appears to share a common receptor with SARS-CoV (ACE-2). Here, we perform structural modeling of the 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein. Our data provide support for the similar receptor utilization between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, despite a relatively low amino acid similarity in the receptor binding module.Compared to SARS-CoV, we identify an extended structural loop containing basic amino acids at the interface of the receptor binding (S1) and fusion (S2) domains, which we predict to be author/funder.

Abstract  Post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) is a powerful tool to understand and control plant metabolic pathways, which is central to plant biotechnology. PTGS is commonly accomplished through delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) into cells. Standard plant siRNA delivery methods (Agrobacterium and viruses) involve coding siRNA into DNA vectors, and are only tractable for certain plant species. Herein, we develop a nanotube-based platform for direct delivery of siRNA, and show high silencing efficiency in intact plant cells. We demonstrate that nanotubes successfully deliver siRNA and silence endogenous genes owing to effective intracellular delivery and nanotubeinduced protection of siRNA from nuclease degradation. This study establishes that nanotubes could enable a myriad of plant biotechnology applications that rely on RNA delivery to intact cells. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Abstract  Public health concerns about recent viral epidemics have motivated researchers to seek transdisciplinary understanding of infection in wildlife hosts. With its deep history devoted to explaining the abundance and distribution of organisms, ecology can augment current methods for studying viral dynamics. However, datasets allowing ecological explorations of viral communities are lacking, and common methods for delineating viral operational taxonomic units (OTUs), or "species", are subjective. Here, we comprehensively sampled 1,086 bats from two Puerto Rican caves and tested them for infection with herpesviruses. Using percent identity of nucleotides and a machine learning algorithm, we categorized herpesviruses into 41 OTUs, representing approximately 80% of all herpesviruses in the host community. Although 13 OTUs were detected in multiple host species, OTUs generally exhibited host specificity by infecting a core host species at a significantly higher prevalence than in all other species combined. Only two OTUs showed significantly different prevalence between host sexes. This work is the first exploration of viral community ecology in a community of wildlife hosts.

Abstract  In numerous instances, tracking the biological significance of a nucleic acid sequence 15 can be augmented through the identification of environmental niches in which the sequence 16 of interest is present. Many metagenomic datasets are now available, with deep sequencing of 17 samples from diverse biological niches. While any individual metagenomic dataset can be 18 readily queried using web-based tools, meta-searches through all such datasets are less 19 accessible. In this brief communication, we demonstrate such a meta-meta-genomic 20 approach, examining close matches to the Wuhan coronavirus 2019-nCoV in all high-21 throughput sequencing datasets in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive accessible with the 22 keyword "virome".

Abstract  Schizophrenia is an idiopathic disorder that affects approximately 1% of the human population, and presents with persistent delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized behaviors.Antipsychotics are the standard pharmacological treatment for schizophrenia, but are frequently discontinued by patients due to inefficacy and/or side effects. Chronic treatment with the typical antipsychotic haloperidol causes tardive dyskinesia (TD), which manifests as involuntary and often irreversible orofacial movements in around 30% of patients. Mice treated with haloperidol develop many of the features of TD, including jaw tremors, tongue protrusions, and vacuous chewing movements (VCMs). In this study, we used genetically diverse Collaborative Cross (CC) recombinant inbred inter-cross (RIX) mice to elucidate the genetic basis of antipsychoticinduced adverse drug reactions (ADRs). We performed a battery of behavioral tests in 840 mice from 73 RIX lines (derived from 62 CC strains) treated with haloperidol or placebo in order to monitor the development of ADRs. We used linear mixed models to test for strain and treatment effects. We observed highly significant strain effects for almost all behavioral measurements investigated (p<0.001). Further, we observed strong strain-by-treatment interactions for most phenotypes, particularly for changes in distance traveled, vertical activity, and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Estimates of overall heritability ranged from 0.21 (change in body weight) to 0.4 (VCMs and change in distance traveled) while the portion attributable to the interactions of treatment and strain ranged from 0.01 (for change in body weight) to 0.15 (for change in EPS).Interestingly, close to 30% of RIX mice exhibited VCMs, a sensitivity to haloperidol exposure, approximately similar to the rate of TD in humans chronically exposed to haloperidol.  
Abstract  The ongoing outbreak of novel corona virus disease 2019 in Wuhan, China, is arousing international concern. This study evaluated whether and when the infected but asymptomatic cases during the incubation period could infect others.We collected data on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and symptom onset day of the confirmed cases, which had been announced by the Chinese local authorities. We evaluated the potential of transmission during the incubation period in 50 infection clusters, including 124 cases. All the secondary cases had a history of contact with their first-generation cases prior to symptom onset.The estimated mean incubation period for COVID-19 was 4.9 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.4 to 5.4) days, ranging from 0.8 to 11.1 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentile). The observed mean and standard deviation (SD) of serial interval was 4.1±3.3 days, with the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles at -1 and 13 days. The infectious curve showed that in 73.0% of the secondary cases, their date of getting infected was before symptom onset of the first-generation cases, particularly in the last three days of the incubation period.The results indicated the transmission of COVID-9 occurs among close contacts during the incubation period, which may lead to a quarantine loophole.Strong and effective countermeasures should be implemented to prevent or mitigate asymptomatic transmission during the incubation period in populations at high risk.  
Abstract  Drug susceptibility, defined by the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), often does not 25 predict whether fungal infections will respond to therapy in the clinic. Tolerance at supra-MIC 26 antifungal drug concentrations is rarely quantified and current clinical recommendations suggest 27 it be ignored. Here, we measured and characterized drug-response variables that could 28 influence the outcomes of fungal infections and be generalizable across major clades of 29 Candida albicans, one of the most frequently isolated human fungal pathogens. We quantified 30 antifungal tolerance as the fraction of growth (FoG) above the MIC and found that it is clearly 31 distinct from susceptibility/resistance measured as MIC. Instead, tolerance is due to the slow 32 growth of subpopulations of cells that overcome drug stress more efficiently than the rest of the 33 population, and correlates inversely with the accumulation of intracellular drug. Importantly, 34 many adjuvant drugs used together with fluconazole, a fungistatic drug, reduce tolerance 35 without affecting resistance. These include inhibitors of major stress response hubs such as 36 Hsp90, calcineurin, PKC1 and TOR. Accordingly, in an invertebrate infection model, adjuvant 37 combination therapy was significantly more effective than fluconazole alone in treating highly 38 tolerant isolates and did not improve the treatment of isolates with low tolerance levels.Furthermore, isolates recovered from immunocompetent patients with persistent candidemia 40 displayed significantly higher tolerance than isolates that were readily cleared by fluconazole. 41 Thus, tolerance correlates with the response to fluconazole therapy in patients and may help 42 predict whether infections will respond to fluconazole alone. Similarly, measuring tolerance may 43 provide a useful clinical parameter for choosing appropriate therapeutic strategies to overcome 44 persistent clinical candidemia.45 46 47 48 49 All rights reserved.

Some infections are recalcitrant to drug treatment due to 'resistance', which 52 refers to microbial growth in the presence of drug concentrations that inhibit susceptible 53 isolates 1,2 . Susceptibility is commonly measured as the Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) 54 after 24 h of growth in the presence of drug 3,4 . Fungal infections generally follow the "90/60" rule 55 for predicting therapeutic outcomes based on in vitro susceptibility testing: ~90% of susceptible 56 isolates and 60% of resistant isolates respond to therapy 5-9 . This implies that infection 57 outcomes are influenced by host factors as well as features of the pathogen that are not 58 reflected by the MIC 10,11 . In effect, organisms that cause persistent infections, defined as those 59 that are not cleared by a course of antifungal treatment, have similar susceptibilities to 60 organisms that are readily cleared by a course of antifungal treatment 12 . Accordingly, it is 61 important to identify measurable parameters that can contribute to disease severity.Only four classes of antifungals are currently in clinical use, and resistance to azoles, 63 including fluconazole (FLC), the most commonly administered antifungal against Candida 64 species, is an increasing problem. Altered drug uptake/drug efflux and changes in ergosterol 65 biosynthesis (the target for azole drugs) 13 are the major known mechanisms of azole resistance.Stress responses have been proposed as a third mechanism of antifungal resistance 14 . A 67 broad range of small molecules enhance antifungal activity in vitro and in vivo, with inhibitors of 68 Hsp90, calcineurin and TOR the most prominent among them 15-18 . Combination therapy using 69 antifungals together with such inhibitors has been proposed as a promising strategy to extend 70 the efficacy of current drugs [19][20][21][22][23][24]25,26,27 . In addition, several psychotherapeutic agents such as 71 fluoxetine, fluphenazine or sertraline can enhance FLC activity against fungal species 21,28-30 .Whether such adjuvants affect therapeutic outcomes remains to be addressed.Persistent candidemia, defined as the failure to clear a bloodstream infection caused by 74 a susceptible organism 12,31,32 , is associated with increased mortality.

Mechanisms underlying persistent candidemia may include variability 77 in the pharmacology of the drug, suboptimal dosing, presence of fungal biofilms on indwelling 78 catheters, and reduced immunity. We posit that some responses to the drug are not captured 79 by measuring the MIC alone and that additional parameters could be used to predict the 80 likelihood that a clinical isolate might respond poorly to antifungal drugs. Furthermore, 81 understanding the mechanisms that underlie these parameters is critical for the development of 82 new therapeutic approaches against persistent Candida infections. 83 MIC measurements have been optimized to minimize or ignore residual fungal 84 growth 9,34,35 , termed 'tolerance' or 'trailing growth', which has been discussed in the literature for 85 over 20 years 36,37 and is detected in 25-60% of clinical isolates 4,10,19,38-44 . This recommendation 86 is based upon studies of acute infections using the mouse model of bloodstream candidiasis 45-87 47 , and the observation that isolates with high trailing growth in mucosal infections respond 88 positively to short term antifungal treatment, despite later recurrence of infection 48 . Trailing 89 growth is sensitive to environmental conditions, including pH, temperature and nutrients 3,49,50 90 and is usually detected in liquid cultures. Definitions of 'tolerance' vary and generally describe 91 survival or growth above inhibitory concentrations 2,10,28,38,51-56 , detected as slow growth within 92 the zone of inhibition using E-strips or disk diffusion assays 57,58 , or in broth microdilution 93 assays 38,39 . Tolerance can be affected by several adjuvant drugs 19-24 , iron levels 19,59 , genes 94 involved in vacuolar protein sorting 38,47 , as well as calcium flux 28,55,59-61 . However, the precise 95 relationship between the outcome of fungal infections and tolerance or trailing growth has not 96 been determined. Because tolerant cells continue to divide in the presence of antifungals, we 97 postulated that they contribute to the persistence and/or recurrence of fungal infections.Here, we measured susceptibility and tolerance in a broad range of clinical isolates 99 spanning the major C. albicans clades 62-64 and asked how these parameters influence fungal 100 infection outcomes.

We 103 found that a range of adjuvant drugs, used in combination with FLC, increased drug cidality by 104 reducing FoG and not MIC and were effective both in vitro and in vivo at inhibiting strains with 105 high (and not low) FoG levels. Finally, highly tolerant isolates were associated with persistent 106 candidemia, suggesting that knowing the tolerance level of an infecting isolate may have 107 important clinical implications and may inform treatment options. 108 109 ResultsTolerance measured as FoG is distinct from drug resistance. We quantified drug 111 responses in C. albicans isolates from different genetic backgrounds and types of infections 112 using diskImageR, a quantitative analysis tool that measures RAD, the radius of the zone of 113 inhibition, an indicator of susceptibility that relates to MIC 69,70 , and FoG, the fraction of growth 114 within the zone of inhibition, relative to the maximum possible growth 65 (Fig. 1a) . A screen of 115 219 clinical isolates (Supplementary Table 1 ) revealed that FoG levels ranged widely from 0.10 116 to 0.85 and did not correlate with RAD levels (Fig. 1b,c) , indicating that FoG and RAD measure 117 independent drug responses. FoG was detected in response to other drugs including fungistatic 118 antifungals (azoles, 5-fluorocytosine) and, to a lesser degree, to fungicidal agents 119  
Abstract  In recent decades, many new flavi-like viruses have been discovered predominantly in different invertebrates and, as was recently shown, some of them may cause disease in humans. The Jingmen tick virus (JMTV) group holds a special place among flavi-like viruses because, in contrast to the "classic" flaviviruses and other flavi-like viruses, they have a segmented ssRNA(+) genome. Two segments of the JMTV genome have homology with regions of the flavivirus genome encoding polymerase and helicase-protease proteins. JMTVs have several open reading frames (ORF) in segments encoding glycoprotein(s) and capsid protein and these ORF are specific only to them. JMTVs greatly differ in virion size. We isolated three strains of Alongshan virus (ALSV), which is a representative of the JMTV group, from adult Ixodes persulcatus ticks collected in two geographically-separated Russian regions in the tick cell line IRE/CTVM19. One of the strains persisted in the IRE/CTVM19 cells without cytopathic effect for three years. Most virions purified from tick cells were spherical with a diameter of approximately 40.5 nm. In addition, we found smaller particles of approximately 13.1 nm in diameter. We obtained full genome sequences of all four segments of two of the isolated ALSV strains, and partial sequences of one segment from the third strain. Phylogenetic analysis on genome segment 2 of the JMTV group clustered our novel strains with other ALSV strains. We found evidence for the existence of a novel upstream ORF in the glycoprotein-coding segment of ALSV and other members of the JMTV group. Significance Statement We isolated three strains of Alongshan virus (ALSV) from adult Ixodes persulcatus ticks from two geographically separate areas of Russia in the Ixodes ricinus tick cell line IRE/CTVM19. One of the strains persisted in the IRE/CTVM19 cells without cytopathic effect for three years. Our study confirmed the value of tick cell lines in virus isolation and maintenance of persistent infection. The majority of virions of the ALSV strain Miass527 were enveloped spherical particles with a diameter of 40.5±3.7 nm. We found evidence for the existence of a novel upstream ORF in the glycoprotein-coding segment of ALSV and other members of the Jingmen tick virus group.  
Abstract  Recombination is a process that unlinks neighbouring loci allowing for independent evolutionary trajectories within genomes of many organisms. If not properly accounted for, recombination can compromise many evolutionary analyses. In addition, when dealing with organisms that are not obligately sexually reproducing, recombination gives insight into the rate at which distinct genetic lineages come into contact. Since June, 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has caused 1106 laboratory-confirmed infections, with 421 MERS-CoV associated deaths as of April 16, 2015. Although bats are considered as the likely ultimate source of zoonotic betacoronaviruses, dromedary camels have been consistently implicated as the source of current human infections in the Middle East. In this paper we use phylogenetic methods and simulations to show that MERS-CoV genome has likely undergone numerous recombinations recently. Recombination in MERS-CoV implies frequent co-infection with distinct lineages of MERS-CoV, probably in camels given the current understanding of MERS-CoV epidemiology.We use the Genetic Algorithm for Recombination Detection (GARD) method (Kosakovsky Pond et al., 2006) , as implemented in the software package HyPhy (Pond et al., 2005) , to look for alternative tree topologies in sequence data. Briefly, the method compares a model where a single tree is derived from the whole alignment and alternative models where breakpoints are introduced into the alignment and phylogenetic trees are derived independently 4 .

Abstract  14 Traveller screening is being used to limit further global spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV) 15following its recent emergence. Here, we project the impact of different travel screening 16 programs given remaining uncertainty around the values of key nCoV life history and 17 epidemiological parameters. Even under best-case assumptions, we estimate that screening will 18 miss more than half of infected travellers. Breaking down the factors leading to screening 19successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally 20 undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were 21 exposed. These findings emphasize the need for measures to track travellers who become ill 22after being missed by a travel screening program. We make our model available for interactive 23 use so stakeholders can explore scenarios of interest using the most up-to-date information. We 24 hope these findings contribute to evidence-based policy to combat the spread of nCoV, and to 25 prospective planning to mitigate future emerging pathogens.  
Abstract  The recent outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China caused by the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emphasizes the importance of detecting novel viruses and predicting their risks of infecting people. In this report, we introduced the VHP (Virus Host Prediction) to predict the potential hosts of viruses using deep learning algorithm. Our prediction suggests that 2019-nCoV has close infectivity with other human coronaviruses, especially the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Bat SARS-like Coronaviruses and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Based on our prediction, compared to the Coronaviruses infecting other vertebrates, bat coronaviruses are assigned with more similar infectivity patterns with 2019-nCoVs. Furthermore, by comparing the infectivity patterns of all viruses hosted on vertebrates, we found mink viruses show a closer infectivity pattern to 2019-nCov. These consequences of infectivity pattern analysis illustrate that bat and mink may be two candidate reservoirs of 2019-nCov.These results warn us to beware of 2019-nCoV and guide us to further explore the properties and reservoir of it. One Sentence Summary: It is of great value to identify whether a newly discovered virus has the risk of infecting human. Guo et al. proposed a virus host prediction method based on deep learning to detect what kind of host a virus can infect with DNA sequence as input.  
Abstract  The pandemic potential of the novel coronavirus (nCoV) that emerged in Wuhan, China, during December 2019 is strongly tied to the number and contagiousness of undocumented human infections. Here we present findings from a proactive longitudinal sampling study of acute viral respiratory infections that documents rates of asymptomatic infection and clinical care seeking for seasonal coronavirus. We find that the majority of infections are asymptomatic by most symptom definitions and that only 4% of individuals experiencing a seasonal coronavirus infection episode sought medical care for their symptoms. These numbers indicate that a very high percentage of seasonal coronavirus infections are undocumented and provide a reference for understanding the spread of the emergent nCoV..

Abstract  Although bats are increasingly becoming the focus of scientific studies due to their unique properties, these exceptional animals are still among the least studied mammals. Assembly quality and completeness of bat genomes vary a lot and especially non-coding RNA (ncRNA) annotations are incomplete or simply missing. Accordingly, standard bioinformatics pipelines for gene expression analysis often ignore ncRNAs such as microRNAs or long antisense RNAs. The main cause of this problem is the use of incomplete genome annotations. We present a complete screening for ncRNAs within 16 bat genomes. NcRNAs affect a remarkable variety of vital biological functions, including gene expression regulation, RNA processing, RNA interference and, as recently described, regulatory processes in viral infections. Within all investigated bat assemblies we annotated 667 ncRNA families including 162 snoRNAs and 193 miRNAs as well as rRNAs, tRNAs, several snRNAs and lncRNAs, and other structural ncRNA elements. We validated our ncRNA candidates by six RNA-Seq data sets and show significant expression patterns that have never been described before in a bat species on such a large scale. Our annotations will be usable as a resource (Electronic Supplement) for deeper studying of bat evolution, ncRNAs repertoire, gene expression and regulation, ecology, and important host-virus interactions.Supplementary information: is available at rna.uni-jena.de/supplements/bats, the Open Science Framework (doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/4CMDN), and GitHub (github.com/rnajena/bats_ncrna).  
Abstract  Recently the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) pneumonia outbreak in China then the world, and the Number of infections and death continues to increases. Search Query performs well in forecasting the epidemics. It is still a question whether search engine data can forecast the drift and the inflexion in 2019-nCov pneumonia. Based on the Baidu Search Index, we propose three prediction models: composite Index, composite Index with filtering and suspected NCP(Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia). The result demonstrates that the predictive model of composite index with filtering performs the best while the model of suspected NCP has the highest forecast error. We further predict the out-of-the-set NCP confirmed cases and monitor that the next peak of new diagnoses will occur on February 16 th and 17 th .  
Abstract  Sequence analyses of RNA virus genomes remain challenging due to the exceptional genetic plasticity of these viruses. Because of high mutation and recombination rates, genome replication by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases leads to populations of closely related viruses, so-called 'quasispecies'. Standard (short-read) sequencing technologies are ill-suited to reconstruct large numbers of full-length haplotypes of (i) RNA virus genomes and (ii) subgenome-length (sg) RNAs comprised of noncontiguous genome regions. Here, we used a full-length, direct RNA sequencing (DRS) approach based on nanopores to characterize viral RNAs produced in cells infected with a human coronavirus. Using DRS, we were able to map the longest (∼26 kb) contiguous read to the viral reference genome. By combining Illumina and nanopore sequencing, we reconstructed a highly accurate consensus sequence of the human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E genome (27.3 kb). Furthermore, using long reads that did not require an assembly step, we were able to identify, in infected cells, diverse and novel HCoV-229E sg RNAs that remain to be characterized. Also, the DRS approach, which circumvents reverse transcription and amplification of RNA, allowed us to detect methylation sites in viral RNAs. Our work paves the way for haplotype-based analyses of viral quasispecies by demonstrating the feasibility of intra-sample haplotype separation. Even though several technical challenges remain to be addressed to exploit the potential of the nanopore technology fully, our work illustrates that direct RNA sequencing may significantly advance genomic studies of complex virus populations, including predictions on long-range interactions in individual full-length viral RNA haplotypes.  
Abstract  The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, originating from Wuhan, China in early December, has infected more than 70,000 people in China and other countries and has caused more than 2,000 deaths. As the disease continues to spread, the biomedical society urgently began identifying effective approaches to prevent further outbreaks. Through rigorous epidemiological analysis, we characterized the fast transmission of COVID-19 with a basic reproductive number 5.6 and proved a sole zoonotic source to originate in Wuhan. No changes in transmission have been noted across generations. By evaluating different control strategies through predictive modeling and Monte carlo simulations, a comprehensive quarantine in hospitals and quarantine stations has been found to be the most effective approach. Government action to immediately enforce this quarantine is highly recommended.

Abstract  Background: The outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remain a huge threat to the public health worldwide. Clinical data is limited up to now regarding nosocomial infection of COVID-19 and the risk factors in favor of severe conversion of non-severe case with COVID-19. Aims: This study analyzed a hospital staff data to figure out general clinical features of COVID-19 in terms of nosocomial infection and explain the association of cardiovascular manifestations (CVMs) with in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 cases. Methods: Retrospective, single-center case series of 41 consecutive hospitalized health staff with confirmed COVID-19 were collected at clinical, laboratory, radiological, treatment data and in-hospital adverse events were collected and analyzed. Final date of follow-up was March 3, 2020. A comparative study was applied between cases with CVMs and those without CVMs.Results: Of all, clinicians and clinical nurses accounted for 80.5%, while nosocomial infection by patient contact accounted for 87.8%. The population was presented with a mean age of 39.1 ± 9.2 and less comorbidities than community population. The three most frequent symptoms of COVID-19 cases analyzed were fever (82.9%), myalgia or fatigue (80.5%) and cough (63.4%). While, the three most frequent initial symptoms were myalgia or fatigue (80.5%), fever (73.2%) and cough (41.5%). There were 95.1% cases featured as non-severe course of disease according to the official standard in China. Patients with CVMs and those without CVMs accounted for 58.5% and 41.5%, respectively. Compared with cases without CVMs, patients with CVMs were presented with lower baseline lymphocyte count (0.99 ± 0.43 and 1.55 ± 0.61, P<0.001), more who had at least once positive nucleic acid detection of throat swab during admission (50.0% and 11.8%, P=0.011), and more received oxygen support (79.2% and 23.5%, P<0.001). The rate of in-hospital adverse events was significantly higher in patients with CVMs group (75.0% and 23.5%, P=0.001). Multivariable logistic regression model .

Abstract  As of February 11, 2020, all prefecture-level cities in mainland China have reported confirmed cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), but the city-level epidemical dynamics is unknown. The aim of this study is to model the current dynamics of 2019-nCoV at city level and predict the trend in the next 30 days under three possible scenarios in mainland China. We developed a spatially explicit epidemic model to consider the unique characteristics of the virus transmission in individual cities. Our model considered that the rate of virus transmission among local residents is different from those with Wuhan travel history due to the self-isolation policy. We introduced a decay rate to quantify the effort of each city to gradually control the disease spreading. We used mobile phone data to obtain the number of individuals in each city who have travel history to Wuhan. This city-level model was

Crozier , an evolutionary biologist, who with his generosity and inquisitiveness inspired many students and scientists, in Australia and abroad. doi: bioRxiv preprint2 Molecular phylogenetics plays a key role in comparative genomics and has an increasinglysignificant impacts on science, industry, government, public health, and society. We posit that the current phylogenetic protocol is missing two critical steps, and that their absence allows model misspecification and confirmation bias to unduly influence our phylogenetic estimates. Based on the potential offered by well-established but under-used procedures (e.g., assessment of phylogenetic assumptions and tests of goodness-of-fit), we introduce a new phylogenetic protocol that will reduce confirmation bias and increase the accuracy of phylogenetic estimates. doi: bioRxiv preprintCONFIRMATION BIAS IN PHYLOGENETICSBayesian methods (77-82)), or using non-parametric phylogenetic methods (i.e., parsimony methods (66,68,70,71,(83)(84)(85)). In reality, many researchers analyze their data using a range of model-based phylogenetic methods, and reports that only use parsimony methods are increasingly rare. Depending on the chosen phylogenetic method, researchers may have to select a suitable model of sequence evolution (i.e., a model that combines the substitution model and the rates-across-sites model) to apply to the sub-MSA. This choice is often made by using model-selection methods (6,86-97).Having chosen a phylogenetic method and, in relevant cases, a suitable model of sequence evolution, the next step involves obtaining accurate estimates of the tree and evolutionary processes that led to the data. Phylogenetic methods are implemented in many programs (66-85) and, depending on the methods chosen, users often also obtain the nonparametric bootstrap probability (98) or clade credibility (99) to measure support for divergence events in the phylogeny.  
Abstract  Background Lassa fever (LF) is increasingly recognized as an important rodent-borne viral hemorrhagic fever presenting a severe public health threat to sub-Saharan West Africa. In 2018, LF caused an unprecedented outbreak in Nigeria, and the situation was worse in 2019. This work aims to study the epidemiological features of outbreaks in different Nigerian regions and quantify the association between reproduction number (R) and local rainfall by using modeling analysis.We quantify the infectivity of LF by the reproduction numbers estimated from four different growth models: the Richards, three-parameter logistic, Gompertz, and Weibull growth models. LF surveillance data are used to fit the growth models and estimate the Rs and epidemic turning points (τ) in different regions at different time periods. Cochran's Q test is further applied to test the spatial heterogeneity of the LF epidemics. A linear random-effect regression model is adopted to quantify the association between R and local rainfall with various lag terms.Our estimated Rs for 2017-18 (1.33 with 95% CI: [1.29, 1.37]) and 2018-19 (1.29 with 95% CI: [1.27, 1.32]) are significantly higher than those for 2016-17 (1.23 with 95% CI: [1.22, 1.24]). We report spatial heterogeneity in the Rs for outbreaks in different Nigerian regions. For the association between rainfall and R, we find that a one unit (mm) increase in .

Abstract  In 2015, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) reached the Republic of Korea, resulting from nosocomial transmission, and was the largest epidemic outside of the Arabian Peninsula. To date, despite various strategies to identify CoV interventions, there are only limited therapeutic options available. To address these unmet medical needs, we used a South Korean MERS-CoV clinical isolate and screened 5,406 compounds, including US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs and bioactive molecules, confirmed 221 hits by dose-response curve analysis in the primary assay, and selected 54 hits with a therapeutic index (TI) greater than 6. Time-ofaddition studies with 12 FDA-approved drugs demonstrated that eight and four therapeutics act on the early-and late stages of the viral life cycle, respectively. Among the early acting drugs, three therapeutics with a TI greater than 100 were cardiotonic agents. Together, our results identify potential therapeutic options for treatment of MERS-CoV infections and could provide a basis for a wider range of coronaviruses, including the currently emerging coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak.  
Abstract  Infectious bronchitis (IB) causes significant economic losses in the global poultry industry. Control of infectious bronchitis is hindered by the genetic diversity of the causative agent, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which has led to the emergence of several serotypes that lack complete serologic cross-protection. While serotyping by definition requires immunologic characterization, genotyping is an efficient means to identify IBVs detected in samples. Sanger sequencing of the S1 subunit of the spike gene is currently used to genotype IBV; however, the universal S1 PCR was created to work from cultured IBV and it is inefficient at detecting mixed isolates. This paper describes a MinION-based AmpSeq method that genetically typed IBV from clinical samples, including samples with multiple isolates. Total RNA was extracted from fifteen tracheal scrapings and choanal cleft swab samples, randomly reverse transcribed, and PCR amplified using modified S1-targeted primers. Amplicons were barcoded to allow for pooling of samples, processed per manufacturer's instructions into a 1D MinION sequencing library, and sequenced on the MinION. The AmpSeq method detected IBV in 13 of 14 IBV-positive samples.AmpSeq accurately detected and genotyped both IBV lineages in three of five samples containing two IBV lineages. Additionally, one sample contained three IBV lineages, and AmpSeq accurately detected two of the three. Strain identification, including detection of different strains from the same lineage, was also possible with this AmpSeq method. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using MinION-based AmpSeq for rapid and accurate identification and lineage typing of IBV from oral swab samples.Infectious bronchitis virus is an enveloped, pleomorphic gammacoronavirus with an unsegmented, single-stranded, positive-sense, 26-27.8 Kb, RNA genome that encodes the nonstructural polyprotein,1a and 1b, and several structural proteins: spike (S), envelop (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N). 38,41 In addition, two accessory genes, expressing 3a, 3b and 5a and 5b, respectively, have also been described. 6, 14, 38 The S protein is highly glycosylated and post-translational cleavage leads to two subunits: S1 and S2. 10,48 Besides acting as the viral attachment protein, the S1 protein is a major target of neutralizing antibodies. 7 As with many attachment proteins that are targets of virus-neutralizing antibodies, the S1 subunit is highly diverse with almost 50% of the amino acids differing among IBV serotypes. 2,21,38 Such variation leads to important biological differences between IBV serotypes and the emergence of novel variants. More than 60 serotypes of IBV have been reported, but the most common serotypes of All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.Massachusetts. 16 This genetic diversity leads to emergence of new serotypes and a lack of complete cross-serotype protection by vaccines. 29 The correlation of IBV genotypes and serotypes of IBV has been reported 45 ; therefore, accurate genotypic identification of IBV is an important step to diagnose IBV in clinical respiratory cases, ensure selection of proper IBV vaccines for use in vaccination programs, and to better understand the epidemiology of this global virus.One of the recent comprehensive classification schemes for IBV uses S1 gene sequencebased phylogeny of IBV and identified six genotypes (I-VI), 32 sub-genotypic lineages, and a number of inter-lineage recombinants in global strains of IBV. 44 Among the six genotypes, genotype I (G-I) is the most diverse group of viruses, with 27 unique lineages. 44 As such, sequencing of the S1 subunit provides important information regarding the classification of IBV within samples.The genetic classification of IBV has relied on genotype-specific RT-qPCR assays, serotype-specific S1 RT-qPCR 32,40 and/or pan-IBV S1 RT-PCR assays coupled with Sanger sequencing. 8,31,49 Genotype-specific RT-qPCRs are limited to short fragments, which may miss important changes in the S1 (~1.6 kb) 44 outside the short target. Additionally, since the target is short, the primers lie within the variable regions of the S1 and may require a different assay for each genotype. Lastly, the pan-IBV S1 primers 1, 17, 22, 23, 25, 33 , while only requiring one reaction, have relatively low sensitivity and are typically used only on egg-cultured virus, which adds an additional, time consuming step and many diagnostic labs do not have SPF embryos readily available. Lastly, cloning of PCR products has been used to detect multiple IBV sub-populations in the sample 30 ; however, this is inefficient when potentially dealing with multiple (three or four) All rights reserved.

As such, the development of a pan-IBV sequencing method to rapidly determine the genotype(s) in samples would aid in lineage typing and tracking of IBV genotypes circulating in poultry flocks.Recently, third generation sequencing technology has been used for detection of viral nucleotides and sequencing ultra-long DNA molecules. 34 The MinION Nanopore sequencer, a new DNA sequencing technology that allows for rapid, in-house, real-time technique detection and differentiation of IBV lineages, may be cost effective and useful in the field. 19 Ampliconbased sequencing has also been used to amplify specific regions of Newcastle disease 3,13 , infectious laryngotracheitis virus 39 Zika 34 , Ebola 35 and avian influenza viruses 46 , by simple RT-PCR and then sequencing on the MinION device. Real-time data analysis, the lack of significant start-up cost investment or maintenance expenses, simultaneous and sequential multiplexing unique to MinION, and the ability to sequence long DNA molecules so that primers are in conserved regions while the product contains the variable region are the features that make this technology highly feasible to be used for disease diagnostics.Accurate identification of IBV genotypes from samples, including detection of multiple isolates from a single sample, is crucial to respiratory disease diagnosis, selection of appropriate IBV vaccines, and epidemiologic studies. Therefore, the aim of the current study is to create a single, amplicon-based protocol to sequence IBV-S1 gene and develop a sequence analysis workflow to identify IBV isolates from clinical swab samples. This method provides a useful assay for IBV and a model for the development of future amplicon sequencing (AmpSeq) based assays.All rights reserved.

The PCR reaction mixture (Expand High Fidelity PCR system, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) was composed of 10 µl of cDNA, 1 µl of 10 µM forward primer, 1 µl of 10 µM reverse primer, 2.5 µl of 10× Expand high fidelity buffer, 1 µl of Expand High Fidelity Enzyme Mix, and 1 µl of 10mM dNTPs, to a final volume to 25 µl with 9 µl of nuclease-free water. The following thermocycling conditions were used for amplicon synthesis: denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min; 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 45 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 2 minutes, and final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. See Table 2 for details about all three primer sets used in this study. PCR products were electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose with SYBR Safe DNA gel stain (Invitrogen) for visual evaluation. Amplified DNA was purified by Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, USA) at 1.6:1 (volumetric bead:DNA) and quantified using the dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay Kit on a Qubit® Fluorimeter 3.0.The amplicons obtained from the tailed S1 primer set were then used to prepare MinIONcompatible DNA libraries. Briefly, each of the amplicons were diluted to 0.5 nM and amplified using barcoding primers (1D PCR Barcoding Amplicon Kit, Oxford Nanopore Technologies, [ONT], UK) and LongAmp Taq 2X Master Mix (New England Biolabs, MA, USA) with the following conditions: 95 °C for 3 min; 15 cycles of 95 °C for 15 seconds, 62 °C for 15 seconds, 65 °C for 80 seconds; and 65 °C for 80 seconds.

Alternatively, de novo 3,26 or reference-based 18 assembly methods have been used in MinION and other deep sequencing platforms. Using a strategy similar to other unbiased laboratory tests (e.g., standard bacterial cultures), an approach was developed to maximize usage of reads (i.e., reads are not discarded based on pre-set length or abundance requirements, similar to how a single colony may be interpreted as a significant result). This approach uses read-based classification against a database containing an equal number of representative sequences per lineage to detect and classify the reads based on their lineage, before conducting read-based classification to the isolate level by using all available IBV sequences in a separate database. Finally, lineage-clustered isolate-level read assignments are interpreted by a veterinary diagnostician to result in reads available for consensus building.The use of a final consensus alignment helps to overcome the individual error rate of MinION sequencing. 3 Similarly, the absence of predetermined metrics used in de novo assembly allows for the informed decision as to how many consensus sequences to build, a bioinformatics problem when dealing with clinical cases that can contain more than one isolate (e.g., similar to how there is not a predetermined number of significant bacterial colonies). Confirmatory followup tests (e.g., RT-PCR) may be needed when dealing with low number of reads in clinical samples; however, future testing of this new technology will allow for creating standards for such confirmatory testing.Taken together, these results suggest the application of MinION-based AmpSeq, specifically for detecting IBV isolates from clinical samples within a few days, compared to several days to weeks and multiple diagnostic assays to culture and detect multiple IBV All rights reserved.

Abstract  Infectious-disease outbreaks are often characterized by the reproductive number R and exponential rate of growth r. R provides information about outbreak control and predicted final size. Directly estimating R is difficult, while r can often be estimated from incidence data. These quantities are linked by the generation interval -the time between when an individual is infected by an infector, and when that infector was infected. It is often infeasible to obtain the exact shape of a generation-interval distribution, and to understand how this shape affects estimates of R. We show that estimating generation interval mean and variance provides insight into the relationship between R and r. We use examples based on Ebola, rabies and measles to explore approximations based on gamma-distributed generation intervals, and find that use of these simple approximations are often sufficient to capture the r-R relationship and provide robust estimates of R.  
Abstract  The focused drug repurposing of known approved drugs (such as lopinavir/ritonavir) has been reported failed for curing SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. It is urgent to generate new chemical entities against this virus. As a key enzyme in the life-cycle of coronavirus, the 3C-like main protease (3CL pro or M pro ) is the most attractive for antiviral drug design. Based on a recently solved structure (PDB ID: 6LU7), we developed a novel advanced deep Q-learning network with the fragment-based drug design (ADQN-FBDD) for generating potential lead compounds targeting SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro . We obtained a series of derivatives from those lead compounds by our structure-based optimization policy (SBOP). All the 47 lead compounds directly from our AI-model and related derivatives based on SBOP are accessible in our molecular library at https://github.com/tbwxmu/2019-nCov. These compounds can be used as potential candidates for researchers in their development of drugs against SARS-CoV-2.author/funder. All rights reserved.

To face the considerable threat of SARS-CoV-2, it is urgent to develop new inhibitors or drugs against this deadly virus. Unfortunately, since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) eighteen years ago, there has been no approved treatment against the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), 3 which is similar to SARS-CoV-2. Repurposing potential drugs such as lopinavir and ritonavir also failed to SARS-CoV-2 injected patients. 4 Structure-based antiviral drug design with a new artificial intelligence algorithm may represent a more helpful approach to get the SARS-CoV-2 targeted inhibitors or drugs. Thanks to the prompt efforts of many researchers, we have several pieces of important information about this vital virus genome and protein structures. We now know that the non-structural protein 5 (Nsp5) is the main protease (M pro ) of SARS-CoV-2 and it is a cysteine protease, which also been called "3C-like protease" (3CL pro ). Moreover, we know that the 3D structure of 3CL pro is very similar to SARS-CoV with a sequence identity of >96% and 3D structure superposition RMSDCα of 0.44 Å as shown in Figures S1 and S2. 3CL pro has been reported as an attractive target for developing anti-coronaviral drugs: 1) this protease is highly conserved in both sequences and 3D structures; 5 2) 3CL pro is a key enzyme for related virus (including SARS and SARS-CoV-2) replication; 3) it only exists in the virus, not in humans. Developing specific antiviral drugs targeting 3CL pro of the specific virus has shown significant success; for example, both approved drugs lopinavir and ritonavir can completely occupy the substrate-binding site of 3CL pro to break down the replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, due to the large difference between HIV and SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro , lopinavir and ritonavir were validated ineffective for inhibiting SARS-Cov-2. 4 On the other hand, the substrate-binding site of 3CL pro is almost the same between the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS as Figure S3 presents. The developed potential inhibitors and drug-design experience targeting SARS-3CL pro may also be applicable to SARS-CoV-2. For author/funder. All rights reserved.

Abstract  Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus named 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has emerged in Wuhan of China and spread to several countries worldwide within just one month.Apart from fever and respiratory complications, acute kidney injury has been observed in some patients with 2019-nCoV. In a short period of time, angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), have been proposed to serve as the receptor for the entry of 2019-nCoV, which is the same for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS). To investigate the possible cause of kidney damage in 2019-nCoV patients, we used both published kidney and bladder cell atlas data and an independent unpublished kidney single cell RNA-Seq data generated in-house to evaluate ACE2 gene expressions in all cell types in healthy kidneys and bladders.Our results showed the enriched expression of all subtypes of proximal tubule cells of kidney and low but detectable levels of expression in bladder epithelial cells. These results indicated the urinary system is a potential route for 2019-nCoV infection, along with the respiratory system and digestion system. Our findings suggested the kidney abnormalities of SARS and 2019-nCoV patients may be due to proximal tubule cells damage and subsequent systematic inflammatory response induced kidney injury. Beyond that, laboratory tests of viruses and related indicators in urine may be needed in some special patients of 2019-nCoV.  
Abstract  Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging tick-borne disease 34 caused by SFTS virus (SFTSV) infection. Despite a gradual increase of SFTS cases and high 35 mortality in endemic regions, no specific viral therapy nor vaccine is available. Here, we 36 developed a single recombinant plasmid DNA encoding SFTSV genes, Gn and Gc together 37 with NP-NS fusion antigen, as a vaccine candidate. The viral antigens were fused with Fms-38 like tyrosine kinase-3 ligand (Flt3L) and IL-12 gene was incorporated into the plasmid to 39 enhance cell-mediated immunity. Vaccination with the DNA provides complete protection of 40 IFNAR KO mice upon lethal SFTSV challenge, whereas immunization with a plasmid 41 without IL-12 gene resulted in partial protection. Since we failed to detect antibodies against 42 surface glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, in the immunized mice, antigen-specific cellular immunity, 43 as confirmed by enhanced antigen-specific T cell responses, might play major role in 44 protection. Finally, we evaluated the degree of protective immunity provided by protein 45 immunization of the individual glycoprotein, Gn or Gc. Although both protein antigens 46 induced a significant level of neutralizing activity against SFTSV, Gn vaccination resulted in 47 relatively higher neutralizing activity and better protection than Gc vaccination. However, 48 both antigens failed to provide complete protection. Given that DNA vaccines have failed to 49 induce sufficient immunogenicity in human trials when compared to protein vaccines, 50 optimal combinations of DNA and protein elements, proper selection of target antigens, and 51 incorporation of efficient adjuvant, need to be further investigated for SFTSV vaccine 52 development.53 54 Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging tick-borne infection 58 endemic to East Asia including China, Korea, and Japan. Gradual rise of disease incidence 59 and relatively high mortality have become a serious public health problem in the endemic 60 countries. In this study, we developed a recombinant plasmid DNA encoding four antigens, 61 Gn, Gc, NP, and NS, of SFTS virus (SFTSV) as a vaccine candidate. In order to enhance cell-62 mediated immunity, the viral antigens were fused with Flt3L and IL-2 gene was incorporated 63 into the plasmid. Immunization with the DNA vaccine provides complete protection against 64 lethal SFTSV infection in IFNAR KO mice. Antigen-specific T cell responses might play a 65 major role in the protection since we observed enhanced T cell responses specific to the viral 66 antigens but failed to detect neutralizing antibody in the immunized mice. When we 67 immunized with either viral glycoprotein, Gn protein induced relatively higher neutralizing 68 activity and better protection against SFTSV infection than Gc antigen, but neither generated 69 complete protection. Therefore, an optimal combination of DNA and protein elements, as 70 well as proper selection of target antigens, might be required to produce an effective SFTSV 71 vaccine. 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 .

Abstract  medRxiv preprint COVID-19 has been impacting on the whole world critically and constantly Since December 2019. We have independently developed a novel statistical time delay dynamic model on the basis of the distribution models from CCDC. Based only on the numbers of confirmed cases in different regions in China, the model can clearly reveal that the containment of the epidemic highly depends on early and effective isolation. We apply the model on the epidemic in Japan and conclude that there could be a rapid outbreak in Japan if no effective quarantine measures are carried out immediately.  
Abstract  December 2019, there have been more than 76,000 cases of COVID-19 in China, causing more than 3,000 medical staff infections. Due to COVID-19 spreads quickly, is highly contagious, and can be fatal in severe cases, and there are no specific medicines, it poses a huge threat to the life and health of nurses and has a large impact on their emotional responses and coping strategies.This study conducted an online questionnaire survey from February 1 to 9, 2020 to investigate the current state of emotional responses and coping strategies of nurses and college nursing students in Anhui Province. This study used a modified Brief COPE (Carver, 1997) and a emotional responses scale.The results found that women showed more severe anxiety and fear than men. Participants from cities showed more anxiety and fear than participants from rural, but rural participants showed more sadness than urban participants. The closer COVID-19 is to the participants, the stronger the anxiety and anger. Compared with Nursing college students, nurses have stronger emotional responses and are more willing to use Problem-focused coping. People may have a cycle of "the more fear, the more problem-focused coping". And people may "The more angry, the more emotion-focused coping", "the more problem-focused coping, the more anxious, the more angry, the more sadness". All rights reserved.

Abstract  Honey bees are eusocial insects, living in a colony that is often described as a superorganism. RNA mobility among cells of an organism has been documented in plants and animals. Here we show that RNA spreads further in honey bees, and is horizontally transferred between individuals and across generations. We found that honey bees share biologically active RNA through secretion and ingestion of worker and royal jellies. Such RNA initiates RNA interference, which is a known defense mechanism against viral infection. Furthermore, we characterized diverse RNA profiles of worker and royal jelly, including fragmented viral RNA. Our findings demonstrate a transmissible RNA pathway with potential roles in social immunity and epigenetic signaling among members of the hive.One of the characteristics of RNA interference (RNAi) is systemic spread of the silencing signal among cells and tissues throughout the organism. Systemic RNAi, initiated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) ingestion, has been reported in diverse invertebrates, including honey bees, demonstrating environmental RNA uptake that undermines homologous gene expression. However, the question why any organism would take up RNA from the environment has remained largely unanswered. Here, we report on horizontal RNA flow among honey bees mediated by secretion and ingestion of worker and royal jelly diets. We show that ingested dsRNA spreads through the bee's hemolymph associated with a protein complex. The systemic dsRNA is secreted with the jelly and delivered to larvae via ingestion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that transmission of jelly-secreted dsRNA to larvae is biologically active and triggers gene knockdown that lasts into adulthood. Finally, RNA extracted from worker and royal jellies harbor differential naturally occurring RNA populations. Some of these RNAs corresponded to honey bee protein coding genes, transposable elements, non-coding RNA as well as bacteria, fungi and viruses. These results reveal an inherent property of honey bees to share RNA among individuals and generations. Thus, our findings suggest a transmissible RNA pathway, playing a role in social immunity and epigenetic signaling between honey bees and potentially among other closely interacting organisms.  
Abstract  The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has expanded rapidly throughout China. Major behavioral, clinical, and state interventions are underway currently to mitigate the epidemic and prevent the persistence of the virus in human populations in China and worldwide. It remains unclear how these unprecedented interventions, including travel restrictions, have affected COVID-19 spread in China. We use real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation on transmission in cities across China and ascertain the impact of control measures. Early on, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China was well explained by human mobility data. Following the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases are still indicative of local chains of transmission outside Wuhan. This study shows that the drastic control measures implemented in China have substantially mitigated the spread of COVID-19.The outbreak of COVID-19 has spread rapidly from its origin in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China (1). A range of interventions have been implemented following the detection in late December 2019 of a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology, and identification of the causative virus SARS-CoV-2 in early January 2020 (2). Interventions include improved rates of diagnostic testing, clinical management, rapid isolation of suspected and confirmed cases and, most notably, restrictions on mobility (hereafter called cordon sanitaire) imposed on Wuhan city on 23 rd January. Travel restrictions were subsequently imposed on 14 other cities across Hubei Province and partial movement restrictions have been enacted in many cities across China. Initial analysis suggests that the Wuhan cordon sanitaire resulted in an average delay of COVID-19 spread to other cities of 3 days (3), but the true extent of the effect of the mobility restrictions and other types of interventions on transmission has not been examined in detail (4, 5).Questions remain over how these interventions affected the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to locations outside of Wuhan. We here use real-time mobility data, crowdsourced line-list data of cases with reported travel .

Abstract  Since the first identified individual of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection on Jan 20, 2020in South Korea, the number of confirmed cases rapidly increased. As of Feb 26, 2020, 1,261 cases of COVID-19 including 12 deaths were confirmed in South Korea. Using the incidence data of COVID-19, we estimate the reproduction number at 1.5 (95% CI: 1.4-1.6), which indicates sustained transmission and support the implementation of social distancing measures to rapidly control the outbreak.  
Abstract  An outbreak of COVID-19 developed aboard the Princess Cruises Ship during January-February 2020. Using mathematical modeling and time-series incidence data describing the trajectory of the outbreak among passengers and crew members, we characterize how the transmission potential varied over the course of the outbreak. Our estimate of the mean reproduction number in the confined setting reached values as high as ~11, which is higher than mean estimates reported from community-level transmission dynamics in China and Singapore (approximate range: 1.1-7). Our findings suggest that R t decreased substantially compared to values during the early phase after the Japanese government implemented an enhanced quarantine control. Most recent estimates of R t reached values largely below the epidemic threshold, indicating that a secondary outbreak of the novel coronavirus was unlikely to occur aboard the Diamond Princess Ship.  
Abstract  Background. The clinical presentation of Novel Coronavirus (2019 infected pneumonia (NCIP) resembles that of other etiologies of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). We aimed to identify clinical laboratory features to distinguish NCIP from CAP.We compared the ability of the hematological and biochemical features of 84 patients with NCIP at hospital admission and 316 patients with CAP. Parameters independently predictive of NCIP were calculated by multivariate logistic regression. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was measured to evaluate the discriminative ability.were significantly different from patients with CAP. Nine laboratory parameters were identified to be highly predictive of a diagnosis of NCIP by multivariate analysis. The AUCs demonstrated good discriminatory ability for red cell distribution width (RDW) with an AUC of 0.88 and Hemoglobin (HGB) with an AUC of 0.82. Red blood cell (RBC), albumin (ALB), eosinophil (EO), hematocrit (HCT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and white blood cell (WBC) had fair discriminatory ability. Combinations of any two parameters performed better than did the RDW alone.  
Abstract  One sentence summary: Disruptions of school and work due to heavy snowfall in the Seattle metro area reduced the total size of respiratory virus epidemics by up to 9%.BACKGROUND: Unusually high snowfall in western Washington State in February 2019 led to widespread school and workplace closures. We assessed the impact of social distancing caused by this extreme weather event on the transmission of respiratory viruses. METHODS: Residual specimens from patients evaluated for acute respiratory illness at hospitals in the Seattle metropolitan area were screened for a panel of respiratory viruses. Transmission models were fit to each virus, with disruption of contact rates and care-seeking informed by data on local traffic volumes and hospital admissions.RESULTS: Disruption in contact patterns reduced effective contact rates during the intervention period by 16% to 95%, and cumulative disease incidence through the remainder of the season by 3% to 9%. Incidence reductions were greatest for viruses 1 .

Abstract  Viruses are one of the major causes of various acute and chronic infectious diseases and thus a major contributor to the global burden of disease. Several studies have shown how viruses have evolved to hijack basic cellular pathways and evade innate immune response by modulating key host factors and signalling pathways. A collective view of these multiple studies could advance our understanding of viral evasion mechanisms and provide new therapeutic perspectives for the treatment of viral diseases. Here, we performed an integrative meta-analysis to elucidate the 17 different host-virus interactomes. Network and bioinformatics analyses showed how viruses with small genomes efficiently achieve the maximal effect by targeting multifunctional and highly connected host proteins with a high occurrence of disordered regions. We also identified the core cellular process subnetworks that are targeted by all the viruses. Integration with functional RNA interference (RNAi) datasets showed that a large proportion of the targets are required for viral replication. Furthermore, we performed an interactome-informed drug re-purposing screen and identified novel activities for broad-spectrum antiviral agents against hepatitis C virus and human metapneumovirus. Altogether, these orthogonal datasets could serve as a platform for hypothesis generation and follow-up studies to broaden our understanding of the viral evasion landscape. author/funder.

Abstract  Domain growth plays an important role in many biological systems, and so the inclusion of domain growth in models of these biological systems is important to understanding how these biological systems function. In this work we present methods to include the effects of domain growth on the evolution of spatial correlations in a continuum approximation of a lattice-based model of cell motility and proliferation. We show that, depending on the way in which domain growth is implemented, different steady-state densities are predicted for an agent population. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the way in which domain growth is implemented can result in the evolution of the agent density depending on the size of the domain. Continuum approximations that ignore spatial correlations cannot capture these behaviours, while those that account for spatial correlations do. These results will be of interest to researchers in developmental biology, as they suggest that the nature of domain growth can determine the characteristics of cell populations. * ross@maths.ox.ac.ukIn this work we examine how domain growth affects the evolution of spatial correlations between agents in IBMs, and importantly, how the way in which domain growth is implemented affects spatial correlations differently.

Abstract  Quick, simple and accurate diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 is very important for the screening and therapy of patients. Although several methods were performed in clinical practice, however, the IgM and IgG diagnostic value evaluation was little performed. 57 suspected COVID-19 infection patients were enrolled in our study. 24 patients with positive and 33 patients with negative nucleic acid test. The positive rate of COVID-19 nucleic acid was 42.10%. The positive detection rate of combination of IgM and IgG for patients with COVID-19 negative and positive nucleic acid test was 72.73% and 87.50%. The results were significantly higher than the nucleic acid or IgM, IgG single detection. hsCRP in the COVID-19 nucleic acid negative group showed significantly higher than the positive groups (P=0.0298).AST in the COVID-19 IgM negative group showed significantly lower than the positive groups (P=0.0365). We provided a quick, simple, accurate aided detection method for the suspected patients and on-site screening in close contact with the population.  
Abstract  Generation intervals, defined as the time between when an individual is infected and when 14 that individual infects another person, link two key quantities that describe an epidemic: 15 the reproductive number, R, and the rate of exponential growth, r. Generation intervals 16 are often measured through contact tracing by identifying who infected whom. We study 17 how observed intervals differ from "intrinsic" intervals that could be estimated by tracing 18 individual-level infectiousness, and identify both spatial and temporal effects, including cen-19 soring (due to observation time), and the effects of susceptible depletion at various spatial 20 scales. Early in an epidemic, we expect the variation in the observed generation intervals to 21 be mainly driven by the censoring and the population structure near the source of disease 22 spread; therefore, we predict that correcting observed intervals for the effect of temporal 23 censoring but not for spatial effects will provide a spatially informed "effective" generation-24 interval distribution, which will correctly link r and R. We develop and test statistical 25 methods for temporal corrections of generation intervals, and confirm our prediction using 26 individual-based simulations on an empirical network.An epidemic can be characterized by the exponential growth rate, r, and the reproductive 32 number, R. The reproductive number, defined as the average number of secondary cases 33 arising from a primary case, is of particular interest as it provides information about the 34 final size of an epidemic (1; 2). However, estimating the reproductive number directly from 35 disease natural history requires detailed knowledge which is not often available, particularly 36 early in an outbreak (3). Instead, the reproductive number can be indirectly estimated from 37 the exponential growth rate, which can be estimated from incidence data (4; 5; 6; 7; 8).These two quantities are linked by generation-interval distributions (9; 10; 11; 12; 13). 39 A generation interval is defined as the time between when a person becomes infected and 40 when that person infects another person (10). Due to individual variation in infection time, 41 the observed generation-interval distribution can change depending on when and how it is 42 measured (10; 14; 15; 16). There are important distinctions to be made when estimating 43 generation intervals: intrinsic generation intervals measure the infectiousness of an infected 44 individual, while observed generation intervals refer to the time between actual infection 45 events. 46 While the intrinsic generation-interval distribution is often assumed to be fixed, the 47 shape of the observed generation-interval distribution depends on when and how intervals 48 are measured (14; 15; 17; 16; 18). When an epidemic is growing exponentially, as often occurs 49 near the beginning of an outbreak, the number of newly infected individuals will be large 50 relative to the number infected earlier on. A susceptible individual is thus relatively more 51 likely to be infected by a newly infected individual. Thus, "backward" generation intervals 52(which look at a cohort of individuals, and ask when their infectors were infected) will be 53 shorter on average than intrinsic generation intervals -the converse is true when an epidemic 54 is subsiding (15; 16; 18).In practice, generation intervals are often measured by aggregating available information 56 from contact tracing. While an epidemic is ongoing, these measurements are "censored": we 57 don't know what happens after the observation time. These censored intervals are similar 58 to backward intervals: there is a bias towards observing shorter intervals, which are more 59 likely to have concluded by the observation time.Realized generation intervals are also affected by spatial structure. In a population 61 that does not mix homogeneously, susceptibility will tend to decrease more quickly in the 62 neighbourhood of infected individuals than in the general population. This means that 63 contacts made late in an individual's infection are more likely to be ineffective due to contacts 64 that were made earlier (because the contactee may have been infected already) As a result, 65 realized generation intervals will have shorter mean than the intrinsic generation-interval 66 distribution. This perspective allows us to reinterpret the finding of (19) that, given an 67 intrinsic generation interval and an observed growth rate, the reproductive number on various 68 network structures is always smaller on a network than would be predicted from homogeneous 69 mixing. These observations allow us to make the following prediction: removing the time-70 censoring bias from observed generation intervals will yield a spatially corrected "effective" 71 distribution that contains information about the population structure and will allow us to 72 2  
Abstract  Many recombinant vector vaccines are capable of replication within the host. They consist of a 5 fully competent vector backbone engineered to express an antigen from a foreign transgene. From the 6 perspective of viral replication, the transgene is not only dispensable but may even be intrinsically 7 detrimental. Thus vaccine revertants that delete the transgene may evolve to dominate the within-8 host population and in doing so reduce the antigenicity of the vaccine. We apply mathematical and 9 computational models to study this process, including the dynamics of vaccine and revertant growth 10 plus the dynamics of innate and adaptive immunity. Although the selective basis of vaccine evolution is 11 easy to comprehend, the immunological consequences are not. One complication is that, despite possible 12 fitness differences between vaccine and revertant, the opportunity for vaccine evolution is limited by the 13 short period of growth before the viral population is cleared. Even less obvious, revertant per se does not 14 interfere with immunity to vaccine except as the revertant suppresses vaccine abundance; the magnitude 15 of this interference depends on mechanisms and timing of viral suppression. Adaptive immunity targeting 16 the foreign antigen is also a possible basis of vaccine inferiority, but it is not worsened by vaccine evolution.Overall, we find that within-host vaccine evolution can sometimes matter to the adaptive immune response 18 targeting the foreign antigen, but even when it does matter, simple principles of vaccine design and the 19 control of inoculum composition can largely mitigate the effects. 20 Author Summary 21 Recombinant vector vaccines are live replicating viruses that are engineered to carry extra genes derived from 22a pathogen -and these produce proteins against which we want to generate immunity. These genes may 23 evolve to be lost during the course of replication within an individual, and there is a concern that this can 24 severely limit the vaccine's efficacy. The dynamics of this process are studied here with mathematical models.The potential for vaccine evolution is somewhat reduced by the short-term growth of the vaccine population 26 before it is suppressed by the immune response. Even when within-host evolution can be a problem, the 27 1 .

Abstract  Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in humans has been associated with congenital malformations and other neurological disorders, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome. The mechanism(s) of ZIKV intrauterine transmission, the cell types involved, the most vulnerable period of pregnancy for severe outcomes from infection and other physiopathological aspects remain unknown. In this study, we analyzed placental samples obtained at the time of delivery from a group of twenty-four women diagnosed with ZIKV infection during the first, second or third trimesters of pregnancy. Villous immaturity was the main histological finding in the placental tissues, although placentas without alterations were also frequently observed. Significant enhancement of the number of syncytial sprouts was observed in the placentas of women infected during the third trimester, indicating the development of placental abnormalities after ZIKV infection. Hyperplasia of Hofbauer cells (HCs) was also observed in these thirdtrimester placental tissues, and remarkably, HCs were the only ZIKV-positive fetal cells found in the placentas studied that persisted until birth, as revealed by immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. Thirty-three percent of women infected during pregnancy delivered infants with congenital abnormalities, although no pattern correlating the gestational stage at infection, the IHC positivity of HCs in placental tissues and the presence of congenital malformations at birth was observed. Placental tissue analysis enabled us to confirm maternal ZIKV infection in cases where serum from the acute infection phase was not available, which reinforces the importance of this technique in identifying possible causal factors of birth defects. The results we observed in the samples from naturally infected pregnant women may contribute to the understanding of some aspects of the pathophysiology of ZIKV.  
Abstract  Rationale: Several studies have estimated basic production number of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). However, the time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP during the outbreak remain unclear. Objectives: We aimed to estimate the basic and time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP across China, and compared them with SARS. Methods: Data on NCP cases by February 7, 2020 were collected from epidemiological investigations or official websites. Data on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) cases in Guangdong Province, Beijing and Hong Kong during 2002-2003 were also obtained. We estimated the doubling time, basic reproduction number (R0) and time-varying reproduction number (Rt) of NCP and SARS. Measurements and main results: As of February 7, 2020, 34,598 NCP cases were identified in China, and daily confirmed cases decreased after February 4. The doubling time of NCP nationwide was 2.4 days which was shorter than that of SARS in Guangdong (14.3 days), Hong Kong (5.7 days) and Beijing (12.4 days). The R0 of NCP cases nationwide and in Wuhan were 4.5 and 4.4 respectively, which were higher than R0 of SARS in Guangdong (R0=2.3), Hongkong (R0=2.3), and Beijing (R0=2.6). The Rt for NCP continuously decreased especially after January 16 nationwide and in Wuhan. The R0 for secondary NCP cases in Guangdong was 0.6, and the Rt values were less than 1 during the epidemic.NCP may have a higher transmissibility than SARS, and the efforts of containing the outbreak are effective.However, the efforts are needed to persist in for reducing time-varying reproduction number below one. now named as Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (NCP), occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The disease has rapidly spread from Wuhan to other areas. As a novel virus, the time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP remain unclear, and it is also important to compare it with SARS.What This Study Adds to the Field: We compared the transmission dynamics of NCP with SARS, and found that NCP has a higher transmissibility than SARS. Time-varying production number indicates that rigorous control measures taken by governments are effective across China, and persistent efforts are needed to be taken for reducing instantaneous reproduction number below one. author/funder.

Abstract  Background: Severe ill patients with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection progressed rapidly to acute respiratory failure. We aimed to select the most useful prognostic factor for severe illness incidence.Methods: The study prospectively included 61 patients with 2019-nCoV infection treated at Beijing Ditan Hospital from January 13, 2020 to January 31, 2020. Prognostic factor of severe illness was selected by the LASSO COX regression analyses, to predict the severe illness probability of 2019-CoV pneumonia. The predictive accuracy was evaluated by concordance index, calibration curve, decision curve and clinical impact curve.Results: The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was identified as the independent risk factor for severe illness in patients with 2019-nCoV infection. The NLR had a cindex of 0.807 (95% confidence interval, 0.676-0.38), the calibration curves fitted well, All rights reserved.

Abstract  Temperate phage genomes are highly variable mosaic collections of genes that infect a bacterial host, integrate into the host's genome or replicate as low copy number plasmids, and are regulated to switch from the lysogenic to lytic cycles to generate new virions and escape their host. Genomes from most Bacterial phyla contain at least one or more prophages. We updated our PhiSpy algorithm to improve detection of prophages and to provide a web-based framework for PhiSpy. We have used this algorithm to identify 36,488 prophage regions from 11,941 bacterial genomes, including almost 600 prophages with no known homology to any proteins. Transfer RNA genes were abundant in the prophages, many of which alleviate the limits of translation efficiency due to host codon bias and presumably enable phages to surpass the normal capacity of the hosts' translation machinery. We identified integrase genes in 15,765 prophages (43% of the prophages). The integrase was routinely located at either end of the integrated phage genome, and was used to orient and align prophage genomes to reveal their underlying organization. The conserved genome alignments of phages recapitulate early, middle, and late gene order in transcriptional control of phage genes, and demonstrate that gene order, presumably selected by transcription timing and/or coordination among functional modules has been stably conserved throughout phage evolution.Here we presented an analysis of over 11,000 bacterial genomes from which we identified 36,488 prophages. Many phages appear to be limited by initiation of translation by the host's machinery, and may increase translation rates by carrying their own tRNA genes, effectively increasing the availability of both tRNAs loaded with methionine and of peptide deformylase. We have also demonstrated that phages maintain a highly conserved gene order that suggests phage genome mosaicism is limited to clusters of conserved genes rather than individual genes.  
Abstract  Plants have a highly sophisticated endomembrane system that is targeted by plant viruses for cell-to-cell movement. The movement protein (MP) of Ourmia melon virus (OuMV) is targeted to plasmodesmata (PD) and forms tubules to facilitate cell-to-cell movement. Despite a number of functionally important regions for correct subcellular localization of OuMV MP has been identified, little is known about the pathways OuMV MP hijacks to reach PD. Here, we demonstrate that OuMV MP localizes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), but not to the multivesicular body/prevacuolar compartment or Golgi, and carries two putative sorting motifs, a tyrosine (Y) and a dileucine (LL) motif, near its N-terminus. Introducing glycine substitutions in these motifs results in loss of OuMV infectivity in Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Live cell imaging of GFP-labeled sorting motif mutants shows that Y motif mutants fail to localize to the TGN, plasma membrane, and PD. Mutations in the LL motif do not impair plasma membrane targeting of MP, but affect its ability to associate with callose deposits at PD. Taken together, these data suggest that both Y and LL motifs are indispensable for targeting of OuMV MP to PD and for efficient systemic infection, but show differences in functionality. This study provides new insights into the role of sorting motifs in intracellular targeting of MPs and vesicle trafficking pathways that plant viruses hijack for cell-to-cell movement.  
Abstract  The ability to detect an infectious agent in a widespread epidemic is crucial to the success of quarantine efforts in addition to sensitive and accurate screening of potential cases of infection from patients in a clinical setting. Enabling testing outside of sophisticated laboratories broadens the scope of control and surveillance efforts, but also requires robust and simple methods that can be used without expensive instrumentation. Here we report a method to identify SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus RNA from purified RNA or cell lysis using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) using a visual, colorimetric detection. This test was additionally verified using RNA samples purified from respiratory swabs collected from COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China with equivalent performance to a commercial RT-qPCR test while requiring only heating and visual inspection. This simple and sensitive method provides an opportunity to facilitate virus detection in the field without a requirement for complex diagnostic infrastructure..

Abstract  Currently, a novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV causes an outbreak of viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China. Little is known about its epidemiological characteristics. Using the travel history and symptom onset of 88 confirmed cases that were detected outside Wuhan, we estimate the mean incubation period to be 6.4 (5.6 -7.7, 95% CI) days, ranging from 2.1 to 11.1 days (2.5 th to 97.5 th percentile). These values help to inform case definitions for 2019-nCoV and appropriate durations for quarantine.  
Abstract  Background The 2019 novel coronavirus infected pneumonia (COVID-19) represents a significant public health threat. The COVID-19 emerged in December 2009 in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread to other regions and countries. The variation in transmission patterns and disease spread in regard to time or among different locations, partially reflecting the public health intervention effects, remains to be quantified. As most transmissibility-related epidemic parameters are unknown, we sought, with minimal assumptions, to estimate real-time transmissibility and forecast new cases using dynamic modelling.Methods Using the cases reported from the National Health Commission of China and transportation data, including the total number of travelling hours through railway, airplane, and car outbound from Wuhan, we have built a time-series model to estimate real-time underlying transmission rates of newly generated cases sequentially from in Wuhan, Hubei province and other 28 provinces in China. We quantified the instantaneous transmission rate and relative reproduction number (R t ) of COVID-19, and evaluated whether public health intervention affected the case transmissibility in each province. Based on the current estimates, we have predicted the trend of disease spread with a high level of certainty.Findings We estimated that R t declined from the range of 4 to 5 towards  
Abstract  One unexplored aspect of HIV-1 genetic architecture is how codon choice influences 27 population diversity and evolvability. Here we compared the development of HIV-1 28 resistance to protease inhibitors (PIs) between wild-type (WT) virus and a synthetic 29 virus (MAX) carrying a codon-pair re-engineered protease sequence including 38 (13%) 30 synonymous mutations. WT and MAX viruses showed indistinguishable replication in 31 MT-4 cells or PBMCs. Both viruses were subjected to serial passages in MT-4 cells 32 with selective pressure from the PIs atazanavir (ATV) and darunavir (DRV). After 32 33 successive passages, both the WT and MAX viruses developed phenotypic resistance to 34PIs (IC 50 14.6 ± 5.3 and 21.2 ± 9 nM for ATV, and 5. 9 ± 1.0 and 9.3 ± 1.9 for DRV, 35 respectively). Ultra-deep sequence clonal analysis revealed that both viruses harbored 36 previously described resistance mutations to ATV and DRV. However, the WT and 37 MAX virus proteases showed different resistance variant repertoires, with the G16E and 38 V77I substitutions observed only in WT, and the L33F, S37P, G48L, Q58E/K, and L89I 39 substitutions detected only in MAX. Remarkably, G48L and L89I are rarely found in 40 vivo in PI-treated patients. The MAX virus showed significantly higher nucleotide and 41 amino acid diversity of the propagated viruses with and without PIs (P < 0.0001), 42 suggesting higher selective pressure for change in this recoded virus. Our results 43 indicate that HIV-1 protease position in sequence space delineates the evolution of its 44 mutant spectra. Nevertheless, the investigated synonymously recoded variant showed 45 mutational robustness and evolvability similar to the WT virus.46 47 IMPORTANCE 48 Large-scale synonymous recoding of virus genomes is a new tool for exploring various 49 aspects of virus biology.

In this study, we evaluated how synonymous recoding of 52 the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease impacts the development of 53 protease inhibitor (PI) resistance. HIV-1 protease is a main target of current 54 antiretroviral therapies. Our present results demonstrate that the wild-type (WT) virus 55 and the virus with the recoded protease exhibited different patterns of resistance 56 mutations after PI treatment. Nevertheless, the developed PI resistance phenotype was 57 indistinguishable between the recoded virus and the WT virus, suggesting that the 58 synonymously recoded protease HIV-1 and the WT protease virus were equally robust 59 and evolvable.  
Abstract  COVID-19 is a complex disease phenotype where the underlying microbiome could influence morbidity and mortality. Amplicon and metagenomic MinION based sequencing was used to rapidly (within 8 hours) identify SARS-CoV-2 and assess the microbiome in nasopharyngeal swabs obtained from patients with COVID-19 by the ISARIC 4C consortium.

Abstract  Viruses maximize their genetic coding capacity through a variety of biochemical mechanisms including programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF), which facilitates the production of multiple proteins from a single transcript. PRF is typically stimulated by structural elements within the mRNA that generate mechanical tension between the transcript and ribosome. However, in this work we show that the forces generated by the cotranslational folding of the nascent polypeptide chain can also enhance PRF. Using an array of biochemical, cellular, and computational techniques, we first demonstrate that the Sindbis virus structural polyprotein forms two competing topological isomers during biosynthesis at the ribosome-translocon complex. We then show that the formation of one of these topological isomers is linked to PRF. Coarse-grained molecular dynamic simulations reveal that the translocon-mediated membrane integration of a transmembrane domain upstream from the ribosomal slip-site generates a force on the nascent polypeptide chain that scales with observed frameshifting. Together, our results demonstrate that cotranslational folding of this protein generates a tension that stimulates PRF. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first example in which the conformational state of the nascent chain has been linked to PRF. These findings raise the possibility that, in addition to RNA-mediated translational recoding, a variety of cotranslational folding and/ or binding events may also stimulate PRF.  
Abstract  There is concern about a new coronavirus, the 2019-nCoV, as a global public health threat. In this article, we provide a preliminary evolutionary and molecular epidemiological analysis of this new virus. A phylogenetic tree has been built using the 15 available whole genome sequence of 2019-nCoV and 12 whole genome sequences highly similar sequences available in gene bank (5 from SARS, 2 from MERS and 5 from Bat SARS-like Coronavirus). FUBAR analysis shows that the Nucleocapsid and the Spike Glycoprotein has some sites under positive pressure while homology modelling helped to explain some molecular and structural differences between the viruses. The phylogenetic tree showed that 2019.nCoV significantly clustered with Bat SARS-like Coronavirus sequence isolated in 2015, whereas structural analysis revealed mutation in S and nucleocapsid proteins. From these results, 2019nCoV could be considered a coronavirus distinct from SARS virus, probably transmitted from bats or another host where mutations conferred upon it the ability to infect humans. author/funder.

Abstract  Pleiotropy, the concept that a single gene controls multiple distinct traits, is prevalent in most organisms and has broad implications for medicine and agriculture. Identifying the molecular mechanisms underlying pleiotropy has the power to unveil previously unknown biological connections between seemingly unrelated traits. Additionally, the discovery of pleiotropic genes increases our understanding of both genetic and phenotypic complexity by characterizing novel gene functions. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping has been used to identify several pleiotropic regions in many organisms. However, gene knockout studies are needed to eliminate the possibility of tightly linked, non-pleiotropic loci. Here, we use a panel of 296 recombinant inbred advanced intercross lines of Caenorhabditis elegans and a high-throughput fitness assay to identify a single large-effect QTL on the center of chromosome V associated with variation in responses to eight chemotherapeutics. We validate this QTL with near-isogenic lines and pair genome-wide gene expression data with drug response traits to perform mediation analysis, leading to the identification of a pleiotropic candidate gene, scb-1 . Using deletion strains created by genome editing, we show that scb-1 , which was previously implicated in response to bleomycin, also underlies responses to other double-strand DNA break-inducing chemotherapeutics. This finding provides new evidence for the role of scb-1 in the nematode drug response and highlights the power of mediation analysis to identify causal genes. : bioRxiv preprint / Here, we use linkage mapping to identify a single overlapping QTL on chromosome V that influences the responses to eight chemotherapeutic compounds. We show that these drug-response QTL also overlap with an expression QTL hotspot that contains the gene scb-1 , previously implicated in bleomycin response (Brady et al. 2019) . Although the exact mechanism of scb-1 is yet unknown, it is hypothesized to act in response to stress (Riedel et al. 2013 ) and has weak homology to a viral hydrolase (Zhang et al. 2018; Kelley et al. 2015) . Together, these data suggest that the importance of scb-1 expression might extend beyond bleomycin response. We validated the QTL using near-isogenic lines (NILs) and performed mediation analysis to predict that scb-1 expression explains the observed QTL for five of the eight drugs. Finally, we directly tested the effect of scb-1 loss of function on chemotherapeutic responses. We discovered that expression of scb-1 underlies differential responses to several chemotherapeutics that cause double-strand DNA breaks, not just bleomycin. This discovery of pleiotropy helps to further define the role of scb-1 by expanding its known functions and provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the nematode drug response.MATERIALS AND METHODSAnimals were grown at 20°C on modified nematode growth media (NGMA) containing 1% agar and 0.7% agarose to prevent burrowing and fed OP50 ( Ghosh et al. 2012) . The two parental strains, the canonical laboratory strain, N2, and the wild isolate from Hawaii, CB4856, were used to generate all recombinant lines. 208 recombinant inbred advanced intercross lines (RIAILs) generated previously by Rockman et al. (Rockman and Kruglyak 2009) (set 1 RIAILs) were phenotyped for expression QTL mapping (detailed below). A second set of 296 RIAILs generated previously by Andersen et al. (Andersen et al. 2015) (set 2 RIAILs) was used more extensively for drug phenotyping and linkage mapping. Near-isogenic lines (NILs) were generated by backcrossing a selected RIAIL for several generations (Brady et al. 2019) , using PCR amplicons for insertion-deletion (indels) variants to track the introgressed region. NILs were whole-genome sequenced to verify clean introgressions. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated deletions of scb-1 were described in Brady et al. (Brady et al. 2019) . All strains are available upon request or from the C. elegans Natural Diversity Resource (Cook et al. 2016) .For dose responses and RIAIL phenotyping, we used a high-throughput fitness assay (HTA) described previously . In summary, populations of each strain were passaged and amplified on NGMA plates for four generations. In the fifth generation, gravid adults were bleach-synchronized and 25-50 embryos from each strain were aliquoted into 96-well microtiter plates at a final volume of 50 µL K medium (Boyd, Smith, and Freedman 2012) . The following day, arrested L1s were fed HB101 bacterial lysate (Pennsylvania State University Shared Fermentation Facility, State College, PA; (García-González et al. 2017) ) at a final concentration of 5 mg/mL in K medium and were grown to the L4 larval stage for 48 hours at 20°C with constant shaking. Three L4 larvae were sorted into new 96-well microtiter plates containing 10 mg/mL HB101 bacterial lysate, 50 µM kanamycin, and either diluent (1% water or 4 .

Abstract  To compare the sex differences in the clinical findings among patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 .We retrospectively collected data of 47 patients diagnosed as severe type of COVID-19 from February 8 to 22, 2020, including demographics, illness history, physical examination, laboratory test, management, and compared differences between men and women.: Of the 47 patients, 28 (59.6%) were men. The median age was 62 years, and 30 (63.8%) had comorbidities. The initial symptoms were mainly fever (34 [72.3%]), cough (36 [76.6%]), myalgia (5 [10.6%]) and fatigue (7 [14.9%]). Procalcitonin level was higher in men than in women (0.08 vs.0.04ng/ml, p=0.002). N-terminal-pro brain natriuretic peptide increased in 16 (57.1%) men and 5 (26.3%) women (p=0.037). Five men (17.9%) had detected positive influenza A antibody, but no women. During 2-week admission, 5 (17.9%) men and 1 (5.3%) woman were reclassified into the critical type due to deterioration. Mortality was 3.6% in men and 0 in women respectively. Four (21.1%) women and one man (3.6%) recovered and discharged from hospital.Conclusion: Sex differences may exist in COVID-19 patients of severe type.Men are likely to have more complicated clinical condition and worse in-hospital outcomes as compared to women. : medRxiv preprint 0.508 Neutrophil count, ×10 9 /L 3.1 (2.1-5.2) 4.1 (2.0-6.9) 2.9 (2.5-3.4) 0.353Lymphocyte count, ×10 9 /L 1.3 (0.7-1.9) 1.2 (0.7-2.0) 1.3 (0.9-1.6) 0869 ≥1.0, No. (%) 30 (63.8) 15 (53.6) 15 (78.9) 0.076 Platelet count, ×10 9 /L 230.0 (157.0-302.5) 218.0 (151.3-320.8) 230.0 (164.0-304.0) 0.696 ＞300.0, No. (%) 14 (29.8) 8 (28.6) 6 (31.6) 0.825 Procalcitonin, ng/ml 0.06 (0.03-0.10) 0.08 (0.05-0.19) 0.04 (0.03-0.07) 0.002 increased (＞0.05), No. (%) 25 (53.2) 19 (67.9) 6 (31.6) 0.014 All rights reserved.

Abstract  Clinical assessment of possible infection with SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus responsible for the outbreak of COVID-19 respiratory illness, has been a major activity of infectious diseases services in the UK and elsewhere since the first report of cases in December 2019. We report our case series of 68 patients, reviewed by Infectious Diseases Consultants at a Regional Infectious Diseases Unit in the UK. We prospectively evaluated our service between the 29 th Jan 2020 and 24 th Feb 2020.Demographic, clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data were collected. We have compared clinical features and subsequent diagnosis between well patients not requiring admission for clinical reasons or antimicrobials with those assessed as needing either admission or antimicrobial treatment.A, RSV, non SARS/MERS coronaviruses, rhinovirus/enterovirus. 9/68 were treated with antimicrobials, 15/68 were admitted to a negative pressure room of whom 5/68 were admitted solely due to an inability to isolate at home. Patients requiring either admission on clinical grounds or antimicrobials (14/68) were similar to those not requiring admission or antimicrobials, with modestly more fever and shortness of breath in the clinically admitted / antimicrobial group. The most commonly prescribed antimicrobials were doxycycline, moxifloxacin and oseltamivir.The majority of patients had mild illness which did not require a clinical intervention to manage. This finding supports a community testing approach supported by clinicians to review the proportion of more unwell patients.  
Abstract  Germline variation at immunoglobulin gene (IG) loci is critical for pathogen-mediated immunity, but establishing complete reference sequences in these regions is problematic because of segmental duplications and somatically rearranged source DNA. We sequenced BAC clones from the essentially haploid hydatidiform mole, CHM1, across the light chain IG loci, kappa (IGK) and lambda (IGL), creating single haplotype representations of these regions. The IGL haplotype is 1.25Mb of contiguous sequence with four novel V gene and one novel C gene alleles and an 11.9kbp insertion. The IGK haplotype consists of two 644kbp proximal and 466kbp distal contigs separated by a gap also present in the reference genome sequence. Our effort added an additional 49kbp of unique sequence extending into this gap. The IGK haplotype contains six novel V gene and one novel J gene alleles and a 16.7kbp region with increased sequence identity between the two IGK contigs, exhibiting signatures of interlocus gene conversion. Our data facilitated the first comparison of nucleotide diversity between the light and IG heavy (IGH) chain haplotypes within a single genome, revealing a three to six fold enrichment in the IGH locus, supporting the theory that the heavy chain may be more important in determining antigenic specificity.  
Abstract  The human coronavirus HCoV-19 infection can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome 47 (ARDS), hypercoagulability, hypertension, extrapulmonary multiorgan dysfunction. Effective 48 antiviral and anti-coagulation agents with safe clinical profiles are urgently needed to improve the 49 overall prognosis. We screened an FDA approved drug library and found that an anticoagulant agent 50 dipyridamole (DIP) suppressed HCoV-19 replication at an EC50 of 100 nM in vitro. It also elicited 51 potent type I interferon responses and ameliorated lung pathology in a viral pneumonia model. In 52 analysis of twelve HCoV-19 infected patients with prophylactic anti-coagulation therapy, we found 53 that DIP supplementation was associated with significantly increased platelet and lymphocyte counts 54 and decreased D-dimer levels in comparison to control patients. Two weeks after initiation of DIP 55 treatment, 3 of the 6 severe cases (60%) and all 4 of the mild cases (100%) were discharged from the 56 hospital. One critically ill patient with extremely high levels of D-dimer and lymphopenia at the time 57 of receiving DIP passed away. All other patients were in clinical remission. In summary, HCoV-19 58 infected patients could potentially benefit from DIP adjunctive therapy by reducing viral replication, 59 suppressing hypercoagulability and enhancing immune recovery. Larger scale clinical trials of DIP 60 are needed to validate these therapeutic effects.61 62  
Abstract  The avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) typically infects the respiratory tract of chickens, but can also spread to other organs. However, the mechanisms of virus dissemination are presently unclear. We show that peripheral blood--derived monocytes/macrophages from chickens (chPBMC) are productively infected by clinical strains of IBV, accompanied by induction of apoptosis. Our data suggest that chPBMCs play a role in the dissemination of IBV, and may be important for viral pathogenesis.All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.  
Abstract  Taxonomic classification for the Coronaviridae can be challenging, due to the wide host tropism 30 and highly variable genome of the viruses in this Family. Within the Alphacoronavirus genus, there is a 31 single species Alphacoronavirus 1 that encompasses several biologically distinct viruses of distinct animal 32 species. Here, we carried out phylogenetic analysis of members of the Alphacoronavirus genus, focusing 33 on the viral spike gene, which is a primary driver of viral tropism and pathogenesis. We identify two 34 distinct clades (A and B) within the Alphacoronavirus 1 species. Alphacoronavirus 1 clade A 35 encompasses serotype I FCoV and CCoV, and Alphacoronavirus 1 clade B, encompasses serotype II 36FCoV and CCoV and TGEV-like viruses. We propose this clade designation, along with the newly 37proposed Alphacoronavirus 2 species, as an improved way to classify the diverse Alphacoronavirus 38 genus.  
Abstract  Viruses possessing class I fusion proteins require proteolytic activation by host cell proteases to mediate 18 fusion with the host cell membrane. The mammalian SPINT2 gene encodes a protease inhibitor that 19 targets trypsin-like serine proteases. Here we show the protease inhibitor, SPINT2, restricts cleavage-20 activation efficiently for a range of influenza viruses and for human metapneumovirus (HMPV). SPINT2 21 treatment resulted in the cleavage and fusion inhibition of full-length influenza A/CA/04/09 (H1N1) HA, 22  
Abstract  Emerging infectious diseases increasingly threaten wildlife populations. Most studies focus 27 on managing short-term epidemic properties, such as controlling early outbreaks. Predicting 28 long-term endemic characteristics with limited retrospective data is more challenging. We 29 used individual-based modelling informed by individual variation in pathogen load and 30 transmissibility to predict long-term impacts of a lethal, transmissible cancer on Tasmanian 31 devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) populations. For this, we employed Approximate Bayesian 32 Computation to identify model scenarios that best matched known epidemiological and 33 demographic system properties derived from ten years of data after disease emergence, 34 enabling us to forecast future system dynamics. We show that the dramatic devil population 35 declines observed thus far are likely attributable to transient dynamics. Only 21% of 36 matching scenarios led to devil extinction within 100 years following devil facial tumour 37 disease (DFTD) introduction, whereas DFTD faded out in 57% of simulations. In the 38 remaining 22% of simulations, disease and host coexisted for at least 100 years, usually with 39 long-period oscillations. Our findings show that pathogen extirpation or host-pathogen 40 coexistence are much more likely than the DFTD-induced devil extinction, with crucial 41 management ramifications. Accounting for individual-level disease progression and the long-42 term outcome of devil-DFTD interactions at the population-level, our findings suggest that 43 immediate management interventions are unlikely to be necessary to ensure the persistence of 44Tasmanian devil populations. This is because strong population declines of devils after 45 disease emergence do not necessarily translate into long-term population declines at 46 equilibria. Our modelling approach is widely applicable to other host-pathogen systems to 47 predict disease impact beyond transient dynamics.  
Abstract  Global airline networks play a key role in the global importation of emerging infectious diseases. Detailed information on air traffic between international airports has been demonstrated to be useful in retrospectively validating and prospectively predicting case emergence in other countries. In this paper, we use a well-established metric known as effective distance on the global air traffic data from IATA to quantify risk of emergence for different countries as a consequence of direct importation from China, and compare it against arrival times for the first 24 countries. Using this model trained on official first reports from WHO, we estimate time of arrival (ToA) for all other countries. We then incorporate data on airline suspensions to recompute the effective distance and assess the effect of such cancellations in delaying the estimated arrival time for all other countries. Finally we use the infectious disease vulnerability indices to explain some of the estimated reporting delays.  
Abstract  Rotavirus (RV) replicates in round-shaped cytoplasmic viral factories although 37 how they assemble remains unknown. 38During RV infection, NSP5 undergoes hyperphosphorylation, which is primed by 39 the phosphorylation of a single serine residue. The role of this post-translational 40 modification in the formation of viroplasms and its impact on the virus replication 41 remains obscure. Here we investigated the role of NSP5 during RV infection by 42 taking advantage of a modified fully tractable reverse genetics system. An NSP5 43 trans-complementing cell line was used to generate and characterise several 44 recombinant rotaviruses (rRVs) with mutations in NSP5. We demonstrate that a 45 rRV lacking NSP5, was completely unable to assemble viroplasms and to 46 replicate, confirming its pivotal role in rotavirus replication. 47A number of mutants with impaired NSP5 phosphorylation were generated to 48 further interrogate the function of this post-translational modification in the 49 assembly of replication-competent viroplasms. We showed that the rRV mutant 50 strains exhibit impaired viral replication and the ability to assemble round-shaped 51 viroplasms in MA104 cells. Furthermore, we have investigated the mechanism of 52 NSP5 hyper-phosphorylation during RV infection using NSP5 phosphorylation-53 negative rRV strains, as well as MA104-derived stable transfectant cell lines 54 expressing either wt NSP5 or selected NSP5 deletion mutants. Our results 55 indicate that NSP5 hyper-phosphorylation is a crucial step for the assembly of 56 round-shaped viroplasms, highlighting the key role of the C-terminal tail of NSP5 57 in the formation of replication-competent viral factories. Such a complex NSP5 58 phosphorylation cascade may serve as a paradigm for the assembly of functional 59 viral factories in other RNA viruses. 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 .

The non-structural 69 protein NSP5, which undergoes a complex hyperphosphorylation process during 70 RV infection, is required for the formation of these virus-induced organelles. 71 However, its roles in viroplasm formation and RV replication have never been 72 directly assessed due to the lack of a fully tractable reverse genetics (RG) 73 system for rotaviruses. Here we show a novel application of a recently developed 74 RG system by establishing a stable trans-complementing NSP5-producing cell 75 line required to rescue rotaviruses with mutations in NSP5. This approach 76 allowed us to provide the first direct evidence of the pivotal role of this protein 77 during RV replication. Furthermore, using recombinant RV mutants we shed light 78 on the molecular mechanism of NSP5 hyperphosphorylation during infection and 79 its involvement in the assembly and maturation of replication-competent 80 viroplasms. 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97  
Abstract  In current severe global emergency situation of 2019-nCov outbreak, it is imperative to identify vulnerable and susceptible groups for effective protection and care. Recently, studies found that 2019-nCov and SARS-nCov share the same receptor, ACE2. In this study, we analyzed five large-scale bulk transcriptomic datasets of normal lung tissue and two single-cell transcriptomic datasets to investigate the disparities related to race, age, gender and smoking status in ACE2 gene expression and its distribution among cell types.We didn't find significant disparities in ACE2 gene expression between racial groups (Asian vs Caucasian), age groups (>60 vs <60) or gender groups (male vs female). However, we observed significantly higher ACE2 gene expression in former smoker's lung compared to non-smoker's lung. Also, we found higher ACE2 gene expression in Asian current smokers compared to non-smokers but not in Caucasian current smokers, which may indicate an existence of gene-smoking interaction. In addition, we found that ACE2 gene is expressed in specific cell types related to smoking history and location. In bronchial epithelium, ACE2 is actively expressed in goblet cells of current smokers and club cells of non-smokers. In alveoli, ACE2 is actively expressed in remodelled AT2 cells of former smokers. Together, this study indicates that smokers especially former smokers may be more susceptible to 2019-nCov and have infection paths different with non-smokers. Thus, smoking history may provide valuable information in identifying susceptible population and standardizing treatment regimen.  
Abstract  Background 3In silico bacterial, viral, and human truth datasets were generated to evaluate available metagenomics 4 algorithms. Sequenced datasets include background organisms, creating ambiguity in the true 5 source organism for each read. Bacterial and viral datasets were created with even and staggered 6 coverage to evaluate organism identification, read mapping, and gene identification capabilities of 7 available algorithms. These truth datasets are provided as a resource for the development and 8 refinement of metagenomic algorithms. Algorithm performance on these truth datasets can inform 9 decision makers on strengths and weaknesses of available algorithms and how the results may be best 10 leveraged for bacterial and viral organism identification and characterization. 11 12Source organisms were selected to mirror communities described in the Human Microbiome Project as 13 well as the emerging pathogens listed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The 14 six in silico datasets were used to evaluate the performance of six leading metagenomics algorithms: 15MetaScope, Kraken, LMAT, MetaPhlAn, MetaCV, and MetaPhyler. 16ResultsAlgorithms were evaluated on runtime, true positive organisms identified to the genus and species 19 levels, false positive organisms identified to genus and species level, read mapping, relative abundance 20 estimation, and gene calling. No algorithm out performed the others in all categories, and the 21 algorithm or algorithms of choice strongly depends on analysis goals. MetaPhlAn excels for bacteria 22and LMAT for viruses. The algorithms were ranked by overall performance using a normalized 23 weighted sum of the above metrics, and MetaScope emerged as the overall winner, followed by Kraken 24 and LMAT. 25Conclusions 27 Simulated FASTQ datasets with well--characterized truth data about microbial community composition 28 reveal numerous insights about the relative strengths and weaknesses of the metagenomics algorithms 29 evaluated. The simulated datasets are available to download from the Sequence Read Archive 30 (SRP062063). 31 32  
Abstract  The World Health Organization declared that COVID-19 outbreak constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and the development of reliable laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 became mandatory to identify, isolate and provide optimized care for patients early. RT-qPCR testing of respiratory secretions is routinely used to detect causative viruses in acute respiratory infection. RT-qPCR in-house protocols to detect the SARS-CoV-2 have been described. Validations of these protocols are considered a key knowledge gap for COVID-19, especially if executed in a high throughput format. Here, we investigate the analytical sensitivity and specificity of two interim RT-qPCR protocols for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 executed in a fully automated platform. Under our conditions, the N1 and RdRP (modified) showed the highest analytical sensitivity for their RNA targets. E assay, in its original concentration, was considered a tertiary confirmatory assay. Taken together, N1, RdRP (optimized) and E presented appropriated analytical sensibility and specificity in our automated RT-qPCR workflow for COVID-19 virus, E being at least 4-fold less sensitive than the others. This study highlights the importance of local validation of in-house assays before its availability to the population. The use of the synthetic RT-qPCR target to investigate novel assays diagnostic parameters in automated workflows is a quick, simple effective way to be prepared for upcoming threats. The proposed assay detected the fisrt SARS-CoV-2 infection in Brazilian Central-West..

Abstract  One central goal of genome biology is to understand how the usage of the genome differs between 12 organisms. Our knowledge of genome composition, needed for downstream inferences, is critically 13 dependent on gene annotations, yet problems associated with gene annotation and assembly errors are 14 usually ignored in comparative genomics. Here we analyze the genomes of 68 species across 12 animal 15 phyla and some single-cell eukaryotes for general trends in genome composition and transcription, taking 16 into account problems of gene annotation. We show that, regardless of genome size, the ratio of introns to 17 intergenic sequence is comparable across essentially all animals, with nearly all deviations dominated by 18 increased intergenic sequence. Genomes of model organisms have ratios much closer to 1:1, suggesting that 19 the majority of published genomes of non-model organisms are underannotated and consequently omit 20 substantial numbers of genes, with likely negative impact on evolutionary interpretations. Finally, our 21 results also indicate that most animals transcribe half or more of their genomes arguing against differences 22 in genome usage between animal groups, and also suggesting that the transcribed portion is more 23 dependent on genome size than previously thought. 24 33 34As the number of genome projects has grown, massive amounts of data have become available to study 35 how organisms organize and use their genomes. Genome projects vary substantially in quality of assembly 36 and annotation [3, 4] . Unfortunately, the predicted genes are often taken for granted as being correct when 37 these are only hypotheses of gene structure [5]. For example, one study found that almost half of the genes 38 in the Rhesus monkey genome had a predictable annotation error when compared to the closest human 39 homolog [6]. This has profound implications for all downstream analyses, such as studying evolution of 40 1 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/068627 doi: bioRxiv preprint orthologous proteins [7] and phylogeny based on protein matrices or gene content [8, 9]. When considered 41 across all genes, systematic errors in genome assembly or annotation would severely skew bulk parameters 42 of a genome.While issues of assembly are often thought to be technical problems that are resolved before continuing, 45 all subsequent analyses are dependent upon accurate genome assembly and annotation. The absence of a 46 protein family in a particular organism is only meaningful if it is certain that it is absent from the genome 47 and not merely the annotation, therefore it is of utmost importance that all genes are properly represented.Yet for most genome projects of non-model organisms, there are limited methods to determine if the assem-49 bly and annotation are sufficient for downstream comparative analyses. Internal metrics can be used, such 50 as the fraction of raw genomic reads or ESTs that map back to the assembly, though this does not tell us if a 51 gene is believable in the context of other animals. Alternatively, counts of "universal" single-copy orthologs 52 have been proposed as a metric of genome completeness [10, 11] , though these genes only represent a small 53 subset of all genes (few hundred out of tens of thousands in most animals). 54 55 Identification of universal trends in genome organization and transcription may enable better quantita-56 tive metrics of genome completeness. Mechanistic models relating to evolution of gene content or coding 57 fractions tended to focus on bacteria or archaea because of the relative ease of annotation. In regards to 58 eukaroytes, some patterns in genome size have been discussed [12-14]. Additionally, a handful of studies 59 have analyzed genome size in connection to other parameters such as indels [15], transposon content [16-19], 60 average intron length [20, 21] or total intron length [18]. Despite these advances, none of these studies have 61 estimated the amount of the genome that is genic (exonic plus intronic, including non-coding) based on in-62 dependent examination of single genomes and without averaging over a whole kingdom. Additionally, none 63 of them have described a way to account for technical problems in assembly and annotation. 64 65Here we examine basic trends of genome size and the relationship to annotation quality across animals 66 and some single-celled eukaryotes. We show that assembly and annotation errors are widespread and pre-67 dictable and that many genomes are likely to be missing many genes. We further show that re-annotation 68 of select species with publicly available tools and transcriptome data improves the annotation. Future users 69 may benefit if databases incorporate more recent data from transcriptome sequencing, and update annota-70 tion versions more frequently. Comparison of genomic composition across many animal groups indicated a 71 ratio of introns:intergenic approaching 1:1, suggesting this as a potential parameter to identify genome com-72 pleteness across metazoans, and potentially other eukaryotes. Finally, this implies that animals transcribe 73 at least half of their genomes whereby small, exon-rich genomes transcribe most of the genome and large 74 genomes transcribe approximately half of the genome. 75 76 Methods 77 Genomic data sources 78 Data sources and parameters are available in SupplementalTable 1. 79 80 Genomic scaffolds and annotations for Ciona intestinalis [22], Branchiostoma floridae [23], Trichoplax ad-81 herens [24], Capitella teleta [25], Lottia gigantea [25], Helobdella robusta [25], Saccoglossus kowalevskii [26], 82 Monosiga brevicollis [27], Emiliania huxleyi [28], and Volvox carteri [29] were downloaded from the JGI 83 genome portal. 84 85 Genome assemblies and annotations for Sphaeroforma arctica, Capsaspora owczarzaki [30] and Salpin-86 goeca rosetta [31] were downloaded from the Broad Institute. 87 88 GFF annotations v2.1 [32] for Amphimedon queenslandica were downloaded from the Amphimedon 89 Genome website (http://amphimedon.qcloud.qcif.edu.au/downloads.html), and v1 annotations [33] and as-90 semblies were downloaded from Ensembl. 91 2 .

Abstract  G-quadruplexes are non-canonical nucleic acid structures that control transcription, replication, and recombination in organisms. G-quadruplexes are present in eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and viruses. In the latter, mounting evidence indicates their key biological activity. Since data on viruses are scattered, we here present a comprehensive analysis of putative G-quadruplexes in the genome of all known viruses that can infect humans. We show that the presence, distribution, and location of G-quadruplexes are features characteristic of each virus class and family. Our statistical analysis proves that their presence within the viral genome is orderly arranged, as indicated by the possibility to correctly assign up to two-thirds of viruses to their exact class based on the G-quadruplex classification. For each virus we provide: i) the list of all G-quadruplexes formed by GG-, GGG-and GGGG-islands present in the genome (positive and negative strands), ii) their position in the viral genome along with the known function of that region, iii) the degree of conservation among strains of each G-quadruplex in its genome context, iv) the statistical significance of G-quadruplex formation.

Abstract  The recent outbreak of COVID-19 in Mainland China is characterized by a distinctive algebraic, subexponential increase of confirmed cases with time during the early phase of the epidemic, contrasting an initial exponential growth expected for an unconstrained outbreak with sufficiently large reproduction rate. Although case counts vary significantly between affected provinces in Mainland China, the scaling law t µ is surprisingly universal, with a range of exponents µ = 2.1 ± 0.3. The universality of this behavior indicates that, in spite of social, regional, demographical, geographical, and socio-economical heterogeneities of affected Chinese provinces, this outbreak is dominated by fundamental mechanisms that are not captured by standard epidemiological models. We show that the observed scaling law is a direct consequence of containment policies that effectively deplete the susceptible population. To this end we introduce a parsimonious model that captures both, quarantine of symptomatic infected individuals as well as population wide isolation in response to mitigation policies or behavioral changes. For a wide range of parameters, the model reproduces the observed scaling law in confirmed cases and explains the observed exponents. Quantitative fits to empirical data permit the identification of peak times in the number of asymptomatic or oligo-symptomatic, unidentified infected individuals, as well as estimates of local variations in the basic reproduction number. The model implies that the observed scaling law in confirmed cases is a direct signature of effective contaiment strategies and/or systematic behavioral changes that affect a substantial fraction of the susceptible population. These insights may aid the implementation of containment strategies in potential export induced COVID-19 secondary outbreaks elsewhere or similar future outbreaks of other emergent infectious diseases.  
Abstract  1 Background Since December 2019, pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel 2 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has emerged in Wuhan, China. The exponential increase of 3 the confirmed number of cases of 2019n-CoV is of great concern to the global 4 community. The fears and panic among residents in the epicenters have prompted 5 diverse responses, which are understudied. During such a crisis, community trust and 6 support for the government and health authorities are important to contain the outbreak.7 We aimed to investigate the influence of institutional trust on public responses to the 8 2019-nCoV outbreak. 9 Methods An anonymous Internet-based, cross-sectional survey was administered on 10 January 29, 2020. The study population comprised all residents currently residing or 11 working in the province of Hubei, where Wuhan is the capital city. The level of trust in 12 information provision and preventive instructions, individual preventive behaviors and 13 treatment-seeking behaviors were queried. 14 Findings The majority of the participants expressed a great extent of trust in the 15 information and preventive instructions provided by the central government than by the 16 local government. A high uptake of 2019-nCoV preventive measures was found, 17 particularly among people who had been placed under quarantine. Being under 18 quarantine (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.80 to 3.08) 19 and having a high institutional trust score (OR = 2.23, 95% CI 1.96 to 2.53) were both 20 strong and significant determinants of higher preventive behavior scores. The majority 21 of study participants (85.7%, n = 3,640) reported that they would seek hospital 22 treatment if they suspected themselves to have been infected with 2019 n-CoV. Few of 23 the participants from Wuhan (16.6%, n = 475) and those participants who were under 24 .CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.(which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint .  
Abstract  Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) challenge the well-established sequence-structurefunction paradigm for describing protein function and evolution. Here, we direct a combination of biophysical and cellular studies to further our understanding of how the intrinsically disordered C-terminal tail of FtsZ contributes to cell division in rod-shaped bacteria. FtsZ is a modular protein that encompasses a conserved GTPase domain and a highly variable intrinsically disordered C-terminal tail (CTT). The CTT is essential for forming the cytokinetic Z-ring. Despite poor sequence conservation of the CTT, the patterning of oppositely charged residues, which refers to the extent of linear mixing / segregation of oppositely charged residues within CTT sequences is bounded within a narrow range. To assess the impact of evolutionary bounds on charge patterning within CTT sequences we performed experiments, aided by sequence design, to quantify the impact of changing the patterning of oppositely charged residues within the CTT on the functions of FtsZ from B. subtilis. Z-ring formation is robust if and only if the extent of linear mixing / segregation of oppositely charged residues within the CTT sequences is within evolutionarily observed bounds. Otherwise, aberrant, CTT-mediated, FtsZ assemblies impair Zring formation. The complexities of CTT sequences also have to be above a threshold value because FtsZ variants with low complexity CTTs are not tolerated in cells. Taken together, our results suggest that CTT sequences have evolved to be "just right" and that this is achieved through an optimal extent of charge patterning while maintaining the sequence complexity above a threshold value.  
Abstract  Databases of ICMJE-accepted clinical trial registry platform were searched on February 14, 2020.Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs of COVID-19 were considered. Conditions of patients include common type, severe type or critical type. Interventions include traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western medicine. We excluded trials that for discharged patients, psychological intervention and complications of COVID-19.The general information and outcomes, outcome measurement instruments and measurement times were extracted. The results were analysed by descriptive analysis.19 registry platforms were searched. A total of 97 protocols were included from 160 protocols. For protocols of TCM clinical trials, 76 outcomes from 16 outcome domains were reported, and almost half (34/76, 44.74%) of outcomes were reported only once; the most frequently reported outcome was time of SARS-CoV-2 RNA turns to negative. 27 (27/76, 35.53%) outcomes were provided one or more outcome measurement instruments. 10 outcomes were provided one or more measurement time frame. For protocols of western medicine clinical trials, 126 outcomes from 17 outcome domains were reported; almost half (62/126, 49.21%) of outcomes were reported only once; the most frequently reported outcome was proportion of patients with negative SARS-CoV-2. 27 outcomes were provided one or more outcome measurement instruments. 40 (40/126, 31.75%) outcomes were provided one or more measurement time frame.Outcome reporting in protocols of clinical trials of COVID-19 is inconsistent. Thus, developing a core outcome set is necessary.
