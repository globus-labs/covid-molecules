# COVID Molecules

### ** The contents of this repository website are for research and educational purposes only. **

This repository contains a crowd sourced list of molecules derived from literature and other sources to aid computational screenings for molecules that have been screened experimentally or computationally against coronaviruses (SARS,MERS, SARS-CoV-2).

## Data Structure
`/data/LIT.csv` - A csv file with headers ["molecule", "virus", "reference", "type", "smiles", "pubchem_id", "similarity_calculated", "release"]
* molecule - the name of the molecule (best effort)
* virus - the virus the molecule was screened against (SARS, MERS, SARS-CoV-2)
* reference - the reference from which the information was collected
* type - the type of screening performed ["computational","experimental","mixed"]
* pubchem_smiles - The SMILES as retrieved from pubchem
* canonical_smiles - The oBabel canonical SMILES as computed from the pubchem SMILES
* pubchem_id - The PubChem ID of the molecule if available
* similarity_calculated - `1` if similarities have been calculated to other databases, `0` otherwise
* release - The current release associated with the row of information

Note that similarities will be calculated to molecules in the databases available from the The [nCov-Group Data Repository](https://2019-ncovgroup.github.io/data/), and made available in future releases.

`/data/references.csv` - A line delimited set of references that have been surveyed to arrive at the results

## Updates
`v0.1 (2020-04-21)` - initial availability
`v0.2 (2020-05-08)` - new molecules and inlude Pubchem and canonical SMILES
